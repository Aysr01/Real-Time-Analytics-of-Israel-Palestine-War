This is obviously provocative, especially given the conflict in Gaza and the upcoming Ramadan. These settlements are illegal and widely condemned by Israel's allies and critics alike. It's well known that these settlements are a major roadblock to a cohesive Palestinian state and a significant detriment to any kind of peaceful solution in the region. I had the hope that with how sensitive the conflict is right now, they might pull back on the settlements to give a peaceful solution a chance. But this recent move is further proof that Israel is only willing to pursue a violent solution to the problem, by further aggravating the Palestinian population and using its military might to force Palestinians out of the West Bank.

,1btdf3e,443,,r/Palestine,"Hello 👋 I'm a 19 year old Anarchist, Anti-Zionist Jew living in a settlement in the West Bank. (Temporarily)
Since the genocide began, I started going to a lot of protests against the occupation and genocide of Palestinians. (Organized by ""Radical Bloc TLV"" & ""Free Jerusalem"" on Instagram)
I found a group of Anti-Zionist friends there and we go to protests together when we can.
But It just doesn't feel enough... These protests are only met with curses, dirty looks and police violence.
The last protest I went to faced extreme violence from the police and 4 were arrested for doing nothing but holding signs against the genocide, and one photographer who just did his job taking pictures.
I have heard some people say individuals like me should take militant action against the IOF, but I'm only 19 and I'm not sure I can do that at all, others said I should leave completely because if I'm not helping to fight from ""the belly of the beast"" then I'm just another useless settler.
I don't know what to do, every day I walk outside, there's Israeli flags everywhere and it makes me depressed and hopeless, seeing their propaganda (""Together we'll win"") makes me angry and frustrated.
I thought maybe I can at the very least try to meet Palestinians in occupied Jerusalem and be their friend... help them feel better about the situation somehow, knowing there's Anti-Zionist Israelis like me out there.",2024-04-01 19:41:37,How do I show support from within Israel?,0.94,3575,https://www.reddit.com/r/Palestine/comments/1btdf3e/how_do_i_show_support_from_within_israel/

,17he2wh,1251,,r/Destiny,"Posting this to give insight, and perhaps because I feel like I am living in a nightmare and would like to share this on an online space which has room for nuance.

Friday night, Shabbat dinner by my boyfriend. We say goodbye to his roomate Jacob and his girlfriend. We tease them. They’re on the way to a crazy party in the south. 

Saturday, in the early hours of the morning I heard rockets and sirens. My partner and I both woke up, but weren’t worried. His room is the bomb shelter.

Saturday, I wake up late due to our morning disturbance, and I call out for my boyfriend.

“Nu, is it over?” 

He says to come over and sit on the couch. He’s made me a cup of coffee, and has a weird wired look in his eyes. He tells me to take a sip of coffee. I do, and I laugh because he’s acting strangely. 

And then he explains that we are at war. He explains that Hamas infiltrated from the south, that they took over a military base and a police station, that they’ve attacked a party, and many people have been killed. 

I started to cry instantly. Then he told me, that he has not been able to reach Jacob (fake name) since 8 am, when he texted “Something terrible has happened. Pray for me.”  

Jacob was murdered. His girlfriend, hospitalized. They were meant to sign on an apartment the next day. 

As it turns out, my sister was at that party. She called my mother, hiding in a ditch, and said her goodbyes, because she did not think she would survive. She heard the terrorists shooting people down, and the screaming. She army crawled for hours in the heat of the dessert. 

My sister survived. Thank God. 

There are many difficult parts to the tragedy now. Jacobs funeral was agonizing. My sister is traumatized. My brother is a combat soldier. 

But 2 weeks in to this war, the most difficult part now, has been the slow confirmation of deaths, and seeing my feed full with eulogies.  

It is an incomprehensible feeling of grief.

Edit: unsurprisingly I am getting a shit ton of hate for this post. but thankfully the love as it always does has totally and completely drowned it out. thank you. i read every single comment and some brought me to tears ;__;

to all the Israelis, Shabbat shalom. May this Shabbat bring a moment of peace to your family.❤️",2023-10-27 04:06:44,Reality as an Israeli 23 year old,0.75,2144,https://www.reddit.com/r/Destiny/comments/17he2wh/reality_as_an_israeli_23_year_old/

>https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2013/03/palestinian-female-prisoners.html

TLDR: Palestinian woman raped by an Israeli investigator in 1969. 

>https://www.middleeasteye.net/features/palestinian-women-haunted-abuse-israeli-jails

""Physical intimidation tactics and sexual harassment used by Israeli interrogators"" 

""brushing their hands across her legs to sexually intimidate her.""

TLDR: No rape

>https://mondoweiss.net/2022/08/how-colonizers-weaponize-rape-reflections-from-the-palestinian-case/

TLDR: Rape in 1969 (different than first). 

>https://stoptorture.org.il/en/torture-in-israel-2021-situation-report/

Underwent two body cavity searches against her will. Investigation claiming rape was opened, but was closed due to ""lacking evidentiary basis"". 

TLDR: Court found lack of evidence. What happened is very muddy. 

>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0886109920978618

Can't read full article, but the claims from the abstract are ""Nineteen of the 20 participants stated that they experienced some sort of unwanted verbal and nonverbal sexual comments or gestures, forced nudity, or forced touching by prison personnel."". Does not seem to accuse rape, but full article might. 

>https://www.dci-palestine.org/israeli_interrogator_sexually_assaults_palestinian_child_detainee

15 year old boy raped with an object by Israeli guard in 2021.

""Countless rapes in the 1948 Nakba by IDF soldiers""

>https://www.savethechildren.net/news/stripped-beaten-and-blindfolded-new-research-reveals-ongoing-violence-and-abuse-palestinian

No claims of rape, closest thing would be: ""Some children reported violence and abuse of a sexual nature, including being hit or touched on the genitals and 69% reported being strip searched.""

>https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/dec/15/idf-exhibition-breaking-the-silence

No claims of rape. Closest thing is: ""What took place there was shocking torture including things like finding a thick wooden board in a field, sitting him on it and smashing his balls for several minutes. And then telling him, ‘Look, we like you,’ and kicking his balls."".

>https://genderandsecurity.org/sites/default/files/Weishut_-_Sexual_Torture_of_Palestinian_M_by_Israeli_Authorities.pdf

TLDR: 2 instance of rape on men (1 simulated, 1 rape with an object) between 2005-2012.

>https://www.berghahnjournals.com/view/journals/conflict-and-society/9/1/arcs090105.xml?ArticleBodyColorStyles=full-text

First bit talks about how three Human Rights Activists did investigations about rape and the IDF, and all concluded that sexual violence conducted by the IDF is limited.

The author basically questions why the number of reported sexual violence acts by the IDF against Palestinians is so low. She basically examines structures in place that make it harder and scarier for Palestinian women to come forward with their assaults. For example:

""To understand the cause of the small number of testimonies and reports disclosing sexual violence by Israeli security forces against Palestinians, we must attend to silencing structures of dependence. As shown elsewhere (Sabbagh-Khoury 2010: 177), although military rule over Palestinians living in Israel was abolished in 1966, its traumatic memory is still present in Palestinian citizens of Israel, who continue to employ self-censorship. We can only imagine what level of self-censorship is employed by Palestinians who are currently living under military rule.""

""Sometimes, it is not enough to “believe women” to avoid silencing them. For some women, for some people, their subordination, and their dependence on certain institutions, relegates them to spaces of invisibility and silence.""

TLDR: No claims of rape.

>https://electronicintifada.net/blogs/tamara-nassar/palestinian-child-says-he-was-raped-israeli-interrogator

15 year old boy raped with an object by Israeli guard in 2021. Same story as the earlier link.

TLDR: ""Threats of rape"" 

>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_torture_in_the_occupied_territories

Wiki page says that ""Camp 1391, whose existence is not even officially acknowledged, claim sexual harassment, even rape, forms part of the interrogation techniques."" The [Source](https://books.google.ca/books?id=zXxZDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT632) is from a criminal law textbook that specifically says ""Sexual humiliation and even rape are reportedly used as interrogation techniques"" with a [source](https://foreignpolicy.com/2009/01/21/the-list-the-worlds-most-notorious-prisons/) from an article. That article does not have any sources for the claim. 

TLDR: Rape might happen at Camp 1391. 

#**PART 2: Analysis**

From the 15 links that ""proves that IDF rapes Palestinian women"":

* 7 don't even claim rape. They claim either sexual harassment or threats of rape. 

* 3 are about events that happened in 1969 or earlier. Horrifying acts, but 50+ years ago is hardly relevant to the modern IDF. 

* 1 was a claim that body cavity searches that a prisoner received was rape. Was dismissed in court.

* 1 that claims 2 instances of Palestinian men getting raped (1 simulated, 1 with an object). Seems credible, it uses data from [PCATI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Committee_Against_Torture_in_Israel) which is an Israeli NGO that monitors Israeli detention centers. 

* 1 of a wiki page that goes down a trail to an unsourced ""there might be rape happening there"" claim in reference to [Camp 1391](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_1391). 

* 2 are of the same story of a 15 year old boy getting raped with an object. Absolutely horrifying if it's true, but I have my doubts about the sources. I could only find information about this on two websites. https://electronicintifada.net/ which is a website created by [Ali Abunimah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Abunimah), an American Palestinian who is [""The leading American proponent of a one-state solution to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict""](https://forward.com/israel/152716/lightning-rod-of-the-boycott-israel-movement/). His [Twitter feed](https://twitter.com/AliAbunimah) makes it pretty clear that he's got some pretty heavy anti-Israel bias. He tweets some unhinged shit: [1](https://twitter.com/AliAbunimah/status/1710610208622309852) [2](https://twitter.com/AliAbunimah/status/1710938576924357087) [3](https://twitter.com/AliAbunimah/status/1711321896728383927) [4](https://twitter.com/AliAbunimah/status/1711323398293307554) [5](https://twitter.com/AliAbunimah/status/1712638360471171517). The other source is [Defense for Children Palestine](https://www.dci-palestine.org/) which was [designated as a terrorist organization](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2021-10-22/ty-article/.premium/gantz-declares-six-palestinian-ngos-terrorist-organizations/0000017f-e795-dea7-adff-f7ff13bf0000) in 2021 by Israel. There seems to be a lack of evidence for this claim, but at best the DCI-P source is probably pretty heavily biased. I'm extremely doubtful that this story is real. 

This compilation of links is clearly an attempt to overload readers with information. 99% of people won't read any of the articles (let alone all of them) and will just see some spooky looking headlines. The intention is pretty clearly designed to illicit a reaction of ""holy shit look how many links there are, this must be true and severe"". The OP even says [""I found this out in, like, five minutes.""](https://i.imgur.com/aYxNxDF.png) to try to make a point how clear and obvious it is, but ironically they solidified the point that they just read and shared 15 headlines without actually reading the articles. 

This isn't even to say that IDF soldiers don't rape. It's possible that the IDF keeps a complete tight seal and just completely gags any report of rape. There was the instance of [the gag order on a soldier convicted of rape](https://www.timesofisrael.com/ending-censorship-idf-admits-officer-jailed-in-2017-raped-a-palestinian-woman/) so it's certainly possible that there are more similar instances. I just think supporting your argument with ""well it's probably happening, we just don't know because of gag orders"" is incredibly weak and that seems to be what Hasan left the episode saying. 

From my time spent on this, it is actually crazy how little rape or sexual violence Israel seems to use. Again, it's possible that it's all under gag orders and that it's systemic, but given the lack of evidence it's tough to believe. Given the animosity between both sides, if Israelis were systemically raping Palestinians, I'd be inclined to believe that the Palestinians would want people to know. [This link](https://www.berghahnjournals.com/view/journals/conflict-and-society/9/1/arcs090105.xml?ArticleBodyColorStyles=full-text#bib47) that they posted is ironically a silver bullet to counter the claims that rape is well documented. The essay examines why rape claims against the IDF are so low. They basically conclude that if rape is occurring, systemic barriers may make it hard for Palestinian women to come forward. 

So no Hasan (and Hasan fans) the IDF raping Palestinian women is absolutely not a ""well documented part of Israeli's apartheid apparatus"". Not that any of them will read this, this is more aimed at encouraging this community to actually read articles that people link, because very often it doesn't support what they're trying to argue. 

TLDR: Hasan's community tries to prove that IDF is raping Palestinian women with 15 sources. None of their sources support the argument that the IDF is currently raping Palestinian women.",2023-10-16 15:10:22,"Examining the ""Israelis raping Palestinian women"" claims",0.86,1973,https://www.reddit.com/r/Destiny/comments/1796vct/examining_the_israelis_raping_palestinian_women/

I've been struggling with the realization that perhaps ""this is it"" for Israel. 
The notion that things might not change, that the country is revolving around a worldview marked by conflic, hate and fear, weighs heavily on me.
The recent demonstrations, which initially sparked hope for a shift towards a more inclusive and fair society, have instead highlighted a self-centered approach (Seculars vs Religious Vs Feminists etc.) with little regard towards addressing the deppest issue at stake, which is the treatment of Palestinians and the pursuit of equality and freedom for all.

The last few months and the increasingly violent and genocidal discourse have really emphasized this internal conflict. It has more than ever made me question my connection to my Israeli identity, which encompasses my language, family, friends, and career. The fundamental values that seem to underpin the state are at odds with my own, leading to a feeling of alienation from what I call home.

How does one move on from this? Is it possible to disentangle oneself from an identity that's so deeply ingrained, yet feels fundamentally misaligned with one's values?

""What do you think about the legitimacy of Israel?"" I asked.

I would modify it slightly:
Zionism simply means the belief that the Jewish people , *like all other peoples,* should have a home and be sovereign in their ancestral land.

If you:
1. Support the right of other peoples (the French, Turks, Japanese, Haitians, Egyptians, etc.) to have a home and be sovereign in their ancestral land, but
1. But are anti-Zionist, then you are
1. By definition, anti-Jewish. 

To be anti-Zionist is to say that the Jews alone should be denied a right you think belongs to all other people.

OPdelta,17jbf66,118,,r/changemyview,"EDIT: I'm amending my view to say it's not that people shouldn't use the term Zionist, they should just be aware of how others might use it as a way to mask their antisemitism. People should make clear attempts to push antisemitism from their surroundings so that the discussion regarding Zionism stays on point and not used to further push hate towards marginalized groups who are unrelated to the point in question.

The main things that changed my view is considering how Anti-Israeli protests are now used as vehicles to hide antisemitism, so at this point it really doesn't matter if you use anti-zionism or anti-israeli. And if you switch to a third term, that one would be used as well. 

Instead we need to be aware of antisemites and make an effort to remove them from the discussion. We must not ignore or belittle the attacks going on against Jews right now and ignore the connection to anti-Israeli rallies. Looking away is wrong. 

When it was happening to Muslims in the 2000s,  we didn't look away. We realized legitimate criticism of Islam was being used as a vehicle to paddle Islamophobia. The left has course corrected a bit too far IMO where there can't be any criticism of Islam, as to not seem Islamophobic. We should find a balance, but doing one for Muslims and the opposite for Jews - well, that certainly is not a good look. 

\----------------------------------  


\*\*I'll start with the view and then explain:\*\*Using the term Zionist is a often a dogwhistle attack at Jews and is incredibly antisemitic, some use it legitimately, but because of the difficulty in distinguishing the two and the accusatory nature of use by almost all people - it should be seen as antisemitic and removed from speech.

**Now to clarify:**

First, I am aware that Zionist is a term Jews created and are using themselves in Israel all the time in legitimate use. To those unfamiliar, it is a term derived from the word Zion - another name for Jerusalem, and embodies the hopes and wishes of Jews in exile to one day return home and rebuild an Israeli country to call their own.To put simply - It is an ideological view that there should be a Jewish homeland for Jews and it should be in Zion. And while there are a lot of different views within that ideology about how, when and where the base concept is that.

And it is also okay to be critical against that view ideology without being antisemitic\*.

**So why do I still think it's antisemitic?**

0 - Preface - I'll preface by saying this is not universal, and there might be plenty who use the term Zionist in good faith and have no ill intent. But because it's indistinguishable from those who do have ill intent, the good people end up being a shield for antisemites to hide behind and whitewash their racist hate.1 - **Negative context of the term** \- So to start, it is quite clear that when many discuss Zionism outside of Israel and the Jewish world, they intend it as a negative action of taking other people's land and forcibly building a country in it. It connects Israel's current actions which are perceived as genocide and attempted ethnocleansing of another population in the purpose of realizing the full Zionist dream. It looks at the actions of 1948 through the lens of the end results of today, and sees the whole concept of Zionism as corrupt and poisonous from the very roots of it.And thus for many people, supporting Zionism is for all intents and purposes supporting genocide.

2 - **Interlinking the (negative) term with Jewish people** \- Because Zionism deals with the Jewish population, it ends being a question of each Jew if they support Zionism or not. Nowadays, it is being asked in a pretty aggressive manner towards many Jews whether or not they're Zionists. Even removing the negative context, this has antisemitic undertones since you're posing a question only towards one ethnic group and when you add the context, you're basically putting their backs against the wall, painting a target and then giving them one last chance to correct themselves.It is an attempt to separate the ""clean"" Jews from the ""dirty"" ones, and while it's a question now - how long before it's an assumption made towards every Jew without giving them time to distance themselves.

This is basically linking the two terms together, and ignoring the fact Zionists can be (and are) non-Jews too.

3 - **Using the terms interchangeably** \- In places where antisemitism is more widespread, like many Arab countries, the two terms are used pretty interchangeably, with some organizations only using the term Zionist as to avoid being seen as antisemitic. And whether or not the use is purposeful or a a byproduct of years of rhetorics against Israel - the result remains the same. A Jew is a Zionist and a Zionist is a Jew.

4 - **The historical use of the term to raise antisemitism in the world** \- When we look back to the start of Zionism, and the previous wave of antisemitism in the world, we can see that anti-zionism was used heavily as a tool to spread antisemitism around the world. The fact that there really was a Zionist organization in the start of the 20th century helped it be a pointed weapon towards Jews, creating big conspiracy theories about Zionists and their plans for world domination. Most famously, the 'Protocols of the Elders of Zion' was the biggest fabricated weapon to target Jews indirectly. It originated in Russia as part of the protests and pogroms against Jews which displaced and killed thousands of Jews.It was later adopted by Hitler and used to showcase reasons to hate the Jews, pointing and linking Zionism and Jews. While internally, Hitler didn't discuss Zionism much - externally, he used it as the primary export with which to spread antisemitism in other countries, most specifically, in Arab countries.And it worked too, Arab leaders were already weary of Zionist attempts to settle in Palestine, buying land and immigrating there in masse, and the 1917 Balfour Declaration served as proof that something sinister is brewing. So when Nazi relations with Arab countries tightened, it was easy to point the finger towards all the Jews living in their lands and paint them as evil Zionists that should be killed or expelled (ironically pushing them to Israel).Jews living in many of these Arab countries did not leave due to Zionism, but rather being pushed out for their religion/ethnicity. So there's a demonstrable example of how Anti-Zionism ends up in Antisemitism.

5 - **Anti-Israel vs Anti-Zionism** \- Most anti-Zionist are also not really arguing against the ideological belief that Jewish people should have a home but rather the current actions of the Israel government which might be rooted in Zionism, but aren't necessarily linked. Anti-Zionism might have had a purpose in the years leading up to 1948 since Israel was still not a fact and one could argue against the idea or concept of its formation. But it's been 75 years since, and at this point any beef one has against Israel should be against Israel. There's no reason to be against Zionism since Zionist has already been realized.But more to the point, if you object to what you perceive as genocide or ethnic cleansing, and object to Israel's apartheid practices against Palestine, you should object to Israel or Israel's government. Zionism has nothing to do with it (Well, I concede that Israelis are still motivated by Zionism and one can say that the current government is lead by extreme zionistic ideology. But why muddle the water here when it's easier to stay clean and just object and criticize Israel's current regime).

6\* - **Complexity of being anti-Zionist** \- Even if we say there's merit here to be criticize Zionism since Israel's government is lead by that ideology, what exactly is anti-Zionism? Is it being against Israel as a concept in general, is it against Israel being where it is, or is it just against the idea of  Israel expanding?Since at the base of it Zionism is the ideology that Jews should have a homeland. Being against that, is in a way, being against Jews having an ethnic home. Something that 90%+ all other ethnic groups have and something that all big religions have too, a religious country that protects it. Christianity has plenty (Greece, Denmark, Norway, Argentina, Hungary, Iceland, the Vatican obviously) and Muslim obviously has many countries were Islam is the dominant and protected religion. If you object to the idea of a religious state, why not object to those of other religions?

If you accept that Judaism should have a home and only object to the location, then you only partially object to Zionism which makes it harder to be completely anti-Zionist, but more to the point - Where then? If you object to Zionism at this point in time - are you not just calling for the banishment of 8M Jews from what they've known as their home for the past 75 years, most born to only know it as their home. How is anti-Zionism then not a call to ethnic cleansing?(And if you only object to further expansion and current occupation, then you're pretty much objecting to Israel's actions first and foremost so why tie it with Zionism when that makes it much less clear what you object to).

7 - **Parallels to Jihad -** Just to paint a wider picture here. As a Jewish person, asking me pointedly if I'm a Zionist only because of my ethnicity (as many Jews are practically atheists) especially when it's clear you see Zionism as evil is no different than asking a Muslim if he's a Jihadist. Jihad too is an idea that is even more complex than Zionism and can have plenty of positive implications, but when one asks that of a Muslims, they're obviously relating it to a the negative aspect and ready to attack them. We'd obviously understand how that's wrong even just asking that question, regardless of intention.So why is it not even seen as problematic against Jews?

In summary, calling someone a Zionist can be a slur since many intend it as an accusation of ""support for occupation, genocide and ethno-cleansing"". That term is only being thrown towards Jews and many use it as a tool to separate Jews who you can hate and Jews you shouldn't. In the past it was used to breed undercover antisemitism and since it's only used against Jews but has ""legitimate"" grounds it's nearly impossible to distinguish between legitimate use of the term and a hate-crime use of it.Because of it, this term should really not be used by anyone who is not antisemitic and can instead be replaced with anti Israel rhetorics which is what most non antisemitic people refer to anyway.

Jew does not have to be a Zionist mostly he lives outside of Israel and sees no reason to link to Israel, that is his decision. But when there is the greatest murder of Jews since the Holocaust in a day, there is a crazy rise in anti-Semitism, how can they not see it, how can they not stand against it? How do they not understand that if there is no Israel there is a second holocaust? I'm really trying to understand that those Jews with the most anti-Semitism in a long time,and they don't care. I am from Israel and grew up with the importance of Israel's Judaism, that all Jews in the world are brothers.

,1899bt4,291,,r/IsraelPalestine,"As I have read more and more about the antisemitism vs. Anti-Zionism debate, and as I have seen so many on the left report taking an Anti-Zionist stance, I have become concerned that the definitions of what each side means when they use these terms are getting lost and that this is leading to further division. 

I have read some posts and articles discussing the fact that not only are Jews not a monoloth, but Zionists are also not a monolith. People who identify as Zionists have different perspectives on what Zionism is and/or which pieces of Zionism they identify with. So, my first question is: 

  1) Zionists on this sub: When you say Zionism, what do you mean? What don't you mean?

Yesterday, I read a post by someone identifying as an Anti-Zionist and also arguing for a two state solution. Perhaps this shows my ignorance, but I was not aware that there were Anti-Zionists who felt this way (I thought most didn't think Israel had a right to exist at all). I would love to learn more about the range of what people mean when they use this term. So, for my second question: 

   2) Anti-Zionists on this sub: When you say Anti-Zionism, what do you mean? What don't you mean?

\*\*Request: Please, for the sake of this thread, let's see if we can refrain from assuming what the other side thinks. Let's see if we can define our own stance without claiming as an Anti-Zionists that ""all Zionists think this"" and not claiming as a Zionist that ""all Anti-Zionists think this"". Thank you!

,1bz3erw,253,,r/Jewish,"Okay, this is going to be a spicy one. PLEASE be nice.

Yesterday, I made a post on this sub called [A letter to anti-Zionist Jews/what do you wish they understood?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Jewish/comments/1by7tlz/a_letter_to_antizionist_jewswhat_do_you_wish_they/) There were some really great responses, yet I still felt like there were a lot of Jews on the post who said that they often don't feel heard/feel attacked in this sub. When prompted about these views, it is clear that the majority of Jews who say that they are feeling attacked aren't even anti-Zionist--they just want more space to criticize Israel without being called mean names, and they feel like they can't do that (note that this has not at all been my experience on this sub, I am just relaying what other Jews were saying in that post).

For that reason, I feel like it would be fair to now start a post with the opposite sentiment: For Jews who are less-Zionist, OR just feel like there is not enough room for them to share their views on this sub, what do you wish other members of the sub knew about your views? What questions do you have about why they think about the way they do? What do you hope to see more from the ""more Zionist"" members of this sub?

Now, if you are responding to this post, you are posting at your own risk. I think that if you identify as anti-Zionist, you should be aware that most people in this sub will disagree with you or be hurt by your thoughts, and may not want to continue the conversation from there. But again, many people who may identify as ""anti-Zionist"" are truly just more critical of Israel. So, if that's the case for you, or if you just feel hurt by some of the discourse, what do you want members of this sub to know about your views? What have you noticed happening here that has made you uncomfortable? Most importantly: Do you have any questions that you would like to  ask the more Zionist members of the sub, that you have not been able to get an answer to? A sentiment I saw reflected in the comments of yesterday's post was that many people feel like their questions are simply shut down or not answered, and they did not feel like the comments in yesterday's thread were reaching them/changing their views.

To the Zionists of the sub (and I am included in this)--please, PLEASE be nice and engage respectfully, if you choose to engage (no one will force you to engage, and it is understood if you do not want to participate in this). The people who are going to comment on this are doing so bravely, and this is a space where their voices are allowed to be heard. Instead of reacting harshly, use this as an opportunity to calmly engage further with these people, answer their questions, and explain why you disagree/why you feel like they are wrong.

I am hoping that we can build some bridges between members with dissenting views on this sub. From what I personally have seen, people with dissenting views seem to, at the core, agree more than they disagree, and it is the language we use that affects how we interact with each other.",2024-04-08 17:11:24,A letter FROM Jews who are anti-Zionist/less Zionist Jews--what do you wish more Zionist Jews understood about your views/what questions do you have?,0.74,71,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jewish/comments/1bz3erw/a_letter_from_jews_who_are_antizionistless/

discussion,1c4z0s8,381,,r/IsraelPalestine,"What is a zionist?

Growing up in the United States, having extended family who survived the holocaust, and being descended from russian immigrants fleeing pogroms at the turn of the 20th century, I learned about world 2, the holocaust, antisemitism, and the formation of Israel through a decidedly ""Israel must exist out of necessity,"" lens.

I learned that zionism was the movement of the late 19th and early 20th century to reestablish the Jewish Homeland where it always was. I learned about the bad too, like Irgun's actions before 1948, and of course the antagonistic (putting it mildly) relationship settlers have with non-israelis in the west bank. Ultimately however, I have never considered myself a zionist, because zionism accomplished it's goal: Israel exists as a Jewish State situated in the historic homeland of the Jewish people.

Since October 7, I have seen zionist used in only one context: as a slur to be applied to someone else that you don't agree with. And anti-zionist used as a self-label by the people using zionist as a slur.  
But what is a zionist in this context? Is a zionist someone who believes that now that Israel exists, it should continue to do so and be able to defend its borders within the bounds of generally accepted international law? Or is a zionist something else and if so, what?

If it is the former definition, then isn't an anti-zionist someone who wishes for the destruction of Israel? Why is it that you can be banned from some subs permanently for calling someone a terrorist sympathizer but not for calling someone a zionist because you don't like their support for israel?

Israel exists.  I believe it has a right to continue to do so, as a State that affords all of its citizens equal civil rights, on nothing less than borders following the green line, in peace with its neighbors and with the right to defend its borders and people from all hostility to the limits permitted by generally accepted international law.  If that makes me a zionist, then doesn't it also make anti-zionists a hateful people who do not want what I want?",2024-04-15 23:02:41,What is a zionist?,0.7,43,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1c4z0s8/what_is_a_zionist/

Israel was not founded as a response to the Holocaust. It was founded in 1917 with the Balfour Declaration and the first major organized transfer of Zionists to Palestine was begun in 1933 when they cut a deal with the Nazis known as the ""Haavara Agreement"", or ""Transfer Agreement.""

The Zionists that moved there were not victimized by their Arab neighbors thus leading to the 1948 war. What actually happened was that the Zionist settlers, some incredibly violent from being in Nazi concentration camps, were outfitted with heavy weapons primarily from the Soviets, which they then proceeded to use on the existing population to drive them out of their homes and into exile. This triggered neighboring Arab states to declare war on the newly formed ""Jewish State."" Gazans are the descendants of the people who were driven out, which is why they hate the Zionists.

The Israelis claim technological superiority but I see no demonstrable proof of this. When I dig into it it seems that in almost all cases they are simply expounding on someone else's previous work and claiming it as their own. Their nuclear program was set up by France, their tactical nuclear weapons that they possess were provided by the United States. The decision to give them these weapons is literally insane. In my opinion it has induced a delusion of invincibility in them that makes them openly  psychotic given their circumstances and personality types. In other words, they never should have been entrusted with this level of destructive power.

They have way too much power and influence in the US Government. They have had our House of Representatives declare that anti-Zionism is Antisemitism, which is complete and total pseudoscience. Their over-representation in our government is not explainable by logical methods. Half of White House staffers are Jewish. The vast majority of our government pledges allegiance to Israel. Isreal has been writing our foreign policy for the last three decades (probably longer) and we have been sunk into disastrous Middle Eastern war after disastrous Middle Eastern war. We are now of the cusp of another one, which will put all the previous ones to shame.

I have gotten into knock down/drag out arguments over whether or not Israel is a Theocratic state or Ethno-state. Their ""Right of Return"" is not based on genetic ancestry information, and Jews are extended rights above and beyond what any other group in the country is. After analyzing it all I can determine is that Israel is a theocratic state masquerading as a liberal democracy.

EDIT: Attention all Zionist apologists: Stop coming on here and making emotional diatribes about how I'm an ""Antisemite"" as if anybody doesn't expect that and as if anybody cares.

I'm sick of the merciless, inhuman slaughter that's occuring right now by the IDF. I see it every day on X, which is why they want it shut down. I see the humiliation rituals, the harassment, the sniping of innocent bystanders, the indiscriminate bombing of women and children. So save it because the horse has already left the barn.

You lunatics are dragging us into another war, but your hubris doesn't allow you to see the truth that it will not go the same way as the last ones you dragged us into. This time it's different.

 There is a concerted effort to kill us mentally since it is so tough to militarize.
 First, distinguish Jews from Zionists.  That makes it easier to persecute Jews.  Why?
 Because, first and foremost, many Jews will renounce Israel, dividing the Jewish people and scaring them into identifying as Zionist.  They rely on people's ignorance about Zionism.
 The fact that the vast majority of Jews are Zionists allows for attacks on Jews without consequence, which is not the same thing.

Why a tree? Well look no further than the Hadith:

>The last hour would not come unless the Muslims will fight against the Jews and the Muslims would kill them until the Jews would hide themselves behind a stone or a tree and a stone or a tree would say: ""Oh Muslim, oh servant of Allah!, there is a Jew behind me, come and kill him!"" – But the tree Gharqad will not say, for it is the tree of the Jews. 🌳

>-Sahih muslim 2922

The tree is a perfect emoji for Zionism, taken from this massively antisemitic passage, for a number of reasons. 

1. The Jewish people endure because of a pro-jew tree, haha. 

2. Pro-Palestine people would be forced to explain/confront this passage when anyone asks they what the significance of the tree emoji is, CONSTANTLY exposing them. 

3. Unrelated to the Hadith, we greened the entire desert.

,180y81c,449,,r/IsraelPalestine,"Background: I am a mid 30’s male living in the US. I was raised with a strong Jewish identity but no religion. I absolutely disagree with the expansion of settlements in the West Bank. I hate that Israel is becoming more fundamentalist because Haredi Jews have 2-3x more babies than secular Jews. I think Benjamin Netanyahu should be fired and arraigned for his failure to protect the state of Israel on October 7th, his support for expansion of settlers in the West Bank, and a litany of other aggressions. I have ongoing struggles with how Israel has responded to the Hamas attack, but I generally think it has been heavy-handed and would prefer to see more grace.

I also think that Israel should be allowed to exist as a homeland for the Jewish people. This makes me a zionist. I can understand why people from the Palestinian diaspora and MENA don’t agree that Israel should exist as a homeland for the Jews. My questions for everyone else are:

(1) If you believe that Israel should exist as a homeland for the Jewish people, do you consider yourself a zionist?

opinion,1avn8ib,596,,r/IsraelPalestine,"I've seen a lot of anti-Israel people suggest that even the 1947 UN partition plan was unfair because it gave half the land to Jews who made up less than half the population at the time. I'll be honest, I'm not sure such arguments are made in good faith. This conflict has never been about how many square kilometers Israel should get, and always about Israel's very existence. That said, let's run with this for a moment and genuinely ask how much land Jews should have gotten.

According to their 1914 census, the population of the Ottoman empire as was 18 520 016, of which 187 073 were Jewish.

*(****Note****: not only is this before the influx of refugees that came during the holocaust, it is also before the ""Zionist invasion"" which* [*the PLO says started in 1917*](https://www.pac-usa.org/the_palestinian_charter.htm)*)*

According to [this paper](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/3cn68807) (see the table on page 498-499), the Ottoman empire had a total area of 2.55 Mm^(2) (million square kilometers) as of 1913.

Thus, it seems reasonable that Jews should have gotten 187073/18520016\*2550000 or 25 758 km^(2) of Ottoman territory, significantly more than the [14 100 square kilometers](https://www.thecairoreview.com/essays/framing-the-partition-plan-for-palestine/) allotted by the 1947 plan. In fact, it's almost exactly the amount of land controlled by the British mandate. In fact, it's almost exactly the amount of land in Britain's mandate, which does make me wonder if that was part of the reason the League of Nations drew the borders the way they did.

  
Now, maybe some of you are thinking that none of this matters because any state based on ethnic considerations is wrong regardless the ethnicity in question -- ""doikayt not Zionism"" etc. And sure, I think I could get on board with a world where the Ottoman empire was divided into several secular pluralistic states, each where Jews, Arabs, Kurds, and everyone else could live safely and freely wherever they happened to be located. However this is not the case with *any* of the other states that formed in former Ottoman territory. Every single one of the Arab Muslim states persecuted their once thriving Jewish communities out of existence, meanwhile 20% of citizens of the one Jewish state are Arab Muslims. So if this is your opinion, I would like to ask what it is that you are doing to try and make Lebanon, Iraq, and the Syrian Arab Republic secular and safe for Jews so that a dedicated Jewish state is not necessary.

On the other hand, if you just want Bibi Netanyahu to stop doing war crimes, then... I mean yeah. I think we agree.",2024-02-20 18:24:28,Did Zionists steal half the land?,0.68,54,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1avn8ib/did_zionists_steal_half_the_land/

I say this because of the anti-semitism that is thinly veiled by saying ""no, no, it's not the Jews we hate but the zionists."" Most Jews are zionist by definition the Jews that aren't are either fringe Ultra-Orthodox and believe we have to wait for the messiah to lead us back to Israel ([Neturei Karta](https://www.adl.org/resources/backgrounder/neturei-karta) which are the ones you see being posted online, they just don't think its the right time).

I respect them and they are still my brothers. What is difficult for me to understand is those Jews who say that there is really no justification for the State of Israel to exist because I as an Israeli, see that if Israel ceases to exist there will be a holocaust for the Israelis (and some people say that it is childish for my feeling) or they say that what happened on 7/10 is justified and continue to hate about Israel non-stop and it seems they don't care that anti-Semitism is on the rise either. I have nothing against those who want to be against the actions of the government in Israel (which now the majority of Israel has also realized that Bibi must leave) and stand by the Palestinians, but I expected from those I see as my brothers to also stand by our side instead of just going out on us. It feels like they don't care about the rest of the world's Jews. Or there are those who include all Israeli citizens in all government actions. I'm just trying to understand that really for us in Israel I feel that if there is no Israel there will be a second holocaust, especially for those without a second citizenship. I was raised to believe that the entire Jewish people is one big family, but then I discover that there are those who don't care that half of this family is no longer here.

Israel is a settler colonial and Apartheid state just like Kenya was a little over 60 years ago ,our people were called terrorists and dehumanised and were subject to murder, sexual assault and especially brutal torture, they were herded into villages (reserves) ,people had to pass through checkpoints and there was a system of passbooks not so different to what we see in the West Bank in Palestine. My own grandfather was once beaten half to death by these colonial officials because his passbook was inconsistence with his movements. Our own people who had lived in these lands for hundreds of years were being slaughtered for having committed the grave sin of resisting the land grabs and what hadn't we done for these people,  we had fought their wars for them in Burma, Malaysia and all those strange lands but they still viewed as less than ,to the coloniser the colonised will never be human ,never.

I’ve been a lurker and a casual Destiny viewer for a while and the Hamas attack finally made me want to start participating in discussions. I’ve been on Reddit since 2015, most of my posts have been related to either Wrestling, Soccer, Music or video games. 

This hasn’t stopped people from calling me a “pro Israeli shill” “Hasbara defense force” and etc. You would think people would actually appreciate someone who is actually on the ground take on things and not a college student thousands of miles away with no actual relation to what’s happening here. 

But the most common thing I’ve been receiving in both comments and in my DM’s is people calling me “a dirty Zionist” “fuck off you Zionist pig” and many other variations including the word Zionist. 

I’ve seen this happen to more and more of my fellow Jews since October 7th: the word “Jew” has been replaced by the word Zionist when blatant antisemitic attacks have been happening. You see if you replace “Jews control all media, they control Hollywood and buy members in congress” with Zionists then that clearly antisemitic trope becomes legitimate. 

Yes I’m a Zionist. I believe in Israel’s right to exist. I also believe in the Palestinian’s right to exist safely in their own country in a two state solution. Those two things do not contradict. 

Stop using Zionist as a curse word. If you think you’re insulting us you’re not, you’re just exposing yourself as antisemitic. I’m sick of people blatantly and obviously showing their Jew hatred and not being called out for it because they replace the Jew word with Zionist.

discussion,1b6m33i,370,,r/IsraelPalestine,"Hey everyone,

I wanted to spark a discussion on the topic of Zionists. It's a complex and often contentious issue, so I'm curious to hear a variety of perspectives. 

For some, Zionism represents the belief in the right of the Jewish people to have a homeland in the historic land of Israel. It's seen as a movement of national liberation and self-determination. Supporters argue that Israel serves as a safe haven for Jews, especially in the wake of historical persecution and the Holocaust.

On the other hand, there are critics who view Zionism through a different lens. They argue that the establishment of Israel involved the displacement and mistreatment of Palestinian Arabs, leading to ongoing conflict and suffering. Some see Zionism as a form of colonialism and argue that it perpetuates injustice against Palestinians, including the occupation of territories and restrictions on their rights.

Common counterarguments to criticisms of Zionism often include the mention of Israel's security concerns, its democratic values in a volatile region, and the need for a Jewish homeland given historical persecution. Additionally, proponents of Zionism emphasize Israel's contributions to technology, culture, and innovation, as well as its status as a refuge for Jews from around the world.

However, it's essential to acknowledge the complexities and nuances of this issue. While supporting the right of Jewish self-determination, one can also advocate for the rights and dignity of Palestinians and a peaceful resolution to the conflict.

In my opinion, it's crucial to engage in respectful and open dialogue on this topic, recognizing the legitimate concerns and grievances on all sides. We can strive for a future where both Israelis and Palestinians can live in peace and security, with their rights and aspirations respected.

The first tweet seems plausible. An Israeli who wants to see if her Lebanese client minds her nationality and wonders if that makes it hard to work with due to the countries warring with each other. 

The 2nd tweet has an entirely different tone and seems much less likely to happen. In here, instead of Frogan bringing up how she’s Lebanese and her experiences. This tweet makes it look like the therapist brought it up unprompted. 

Frogan never brings up anything she said either, for added context. The topics appear to switch heavily and she makes it look like she said nothing to prompt it. Now, if she’s fully telling the truth, I feel sorry for her clearly. But, if she’s leaving things out for a narrative, this is incredibly dishonest and possibly slanderous. 

Of course, these two tweets tell very contradictory stories. One sees a therapist who’s compassionate and wants no conflict with her client, and the other is one who clearly is trying to start a confrontation. 

Of course, I’m not a fan of Frogan by any means, due to her being friends with Houthi fanboy Hasan, and for her smearing Ethan Klein as a zionist because he unfollowed her. 

But is this story false? I can’t exactly say. But it is a lot less likely than the first scenario due to how cartoonishly callous it is. Yes it is possible, and no therapist should say it.

This seems like a good thing, Israel seems necessary to me. Jews have been second class citizens for a millennium and were fairly recently killed in a genocide. So yeah, they should have their own state where they can live freely. And the location seems appropriate, considering their historical ties to the land. And they need not kick out/genocide their Palestinian neighbors to do so, they can just… live next to them?

This seems like an obvious and inoffensive position. But I see people online trash ‘zionists’ as if they believe in some kind of jewish superiority. Am I missing something?

Edit: Prior to this, I just read some articles explaining what zionism was, and then I considered the dictionary definition (I know, cringe, but that’s why I’m here). It seems (from comments) some term baggage comes from Israeli politics. Where the ‘most Zionist’ essentially want to enforce a *strong* Jewish majority and oppress others, which may or may not stem from a sense of racial superiority.

The word of G-d plainly states that the children of Israel (Jews) will [reunite](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gathering_of_Israel) in their homeland after being exiled.

At it's core, zionism is the reuniting of Jews in their homeland after being exiled.

Therefore, every Jew is a zionist by definition. If not for 1948, surely at some point. A Jew who isn't a zionist is like a Christian who rejects Jesus or a Muslim who doubts Muhammad; it's an oxymoron.

That isn't to say that every Jew must implicitly agree with the Israeli government, far from it. But it is to say that every Jew must agree with Israel's right to exist--the right of Jews to continue existing in Israel. To be against Israel's existence is to be against Jews reuniting in their homeland, against the very foundation of Judaism.

Maybe it's not so straightforward but this is why I believe that antizionism IS antisemitism.

What are some supposedly Jewish arguments against zionism? I personally haven't heard any beyond Neturei Karta's incoherent, fringe and often malicious rhetoric, but I do keep observing online discourse repeating the claim, ""There are even Jews against zionism!""

Can anyone clue me in on what that means? What am I missing?

**EDIT**: Based on many thoughtful responses and discussions below, I'm revising my thesis: zionism can not exist without Judaism, but Judaism **can** exist without zionism, as far as the Theodore Herzl kind. That makes perfect sense.

HOWEVER! Zionism as the historical Herzl-et-al initiative toward Jewish sovereignty ended with Israel declaring Independence. If zionism continues to this day, what is it if not the support for continued Jewish sovereignty in the homeland, the agreement that Israel has a right to continue existing and being home to 7 million Jews and 3 million Arabs, etc? If you live in Israel, that's just patriotism. And if you're Jewish, why wouldn't you support that?

I still haven't heard any coherent arguments against modern day ""zionism,"" but the way the term ""anti-zionism"" is being used maliciously against Jews, I'm very much in favor of redefining the term such that one can not reasonably consider themselves anti-zionist without being labeled antisemitic.",2023-11-28 19:54:06,Judaism IS Zionism,0.78,216,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jewish/comments/1863jsp/judaism_is_zionism/

An analogy I came across the other day summarized it well:

It would be completely normal if my partner and I discuss whether we should have a baby or not.

But after the baby is born? I can't imagine anyone sane would even remotely consider discussing if the baby should exist or not.

Israel just marked 75 years, and has 10 million people. Lawyers, families, police, students, fishermen, Jews, Arabs, Christians, the full spectrum.

I haven't seen a single post on reddit, a comment or article in real life, about if any other country out there should or should not exist. Because that would be absurd. And many many countries are younger than Israel, and were born around much more injustice and death than Israel was even if you were to believe the most far-flung theories out there that criticize it.

Why then, is even ""Anti-Zionism"" a concept?

I'd love to hear someone try to help me understand this phenomenon. Can anyone share reddit posts with me where people discuss if we should ""dismantle"" other nations?

Because without any further explanation, it's seeming clear to me that Anti-Zionism is just the same old Anti-Semitism we've seen for centuries, under a vail of a new name.

CONCLUSION:

I was wondering if someone could genuinely help me understand a bit more of the Anti-Zionist argument. There were a lot of hateful arguments, some even making efforts to change history or current facts, which I take it as just reinforcement of the emotional, hateful, and likely anti-semitic nature of the Anti-Zionist belief.

Apart from these, it seems that the main issue is that there are varying ideas to what ""Zionism"" means. Some associate Zionism to the right wing expansionist policies, such as the Settlement program. Others see it as a fanatical religious doctrine about Jewish superiority over Arabs. Neither of these are accepted or shared definitions of ""Zionism"" as far as any reputable source can offer.... So my conclusion is that even these interpretations of Zionism are fueled by a pre-existing hateful narrative, that is clearly involved in anti-Semitism.",2023-04-29 10:24:13,Anti-Zionism seems absurd to me,0.82,117,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/132oa6r/antizionism_seems_absurd_to_me/

My experience in this sub has not been welcoming nor helpful.

**ORIGINAL TEXT:** I don’t involve myself much in politics, etc. so I’ve been out of the loop when it comes to this conflict. People who are pro-Palestinian are often anti-Zionist, or that’s at least what I’ve noticed. Isn’t Zionism literally just support for a Jewish state even existing? I understand the government of Israel is committing homicide. Why be anti-Zionist when you could just be against that one government? It does not make sense to me, considering that the Jewish people living in Israel outside of the government do not agree with the government’s actions. What would be the problem with supporting the creation of a Jewish state that, you know, actually has a good government that respects other cultures? Why not just get rid of the current government and replace it with one like that? It seems sort of wrong to me and somewhat anti-Semitic to deny an ethnic group of a state. Again, it’s not the people’s fault. It’s the government’s. Why should the people have to take the fall for what the government is doing? I understand the trouble that the Palestinians are going through and I agree that the Israeli government is at fault. But is it really so bad that Jewish people aren’t allowed to have their own state at all? I genuinely don’t understand it. Is it not true that, if Palestinians had a state already which was separate from Israel, there would be no war necessary? Why do the Palestinians need to take all of Israel? Why not just divide the land evenly?

discussion,17d5fva,1330,,r/IsraelPalestine,"I’m a Jew, born in USSR and raised in America.

I would read about the nationalisms in the late 1800s, of the Balkan people vs the Austrian-Hungarians, the Irish vs the English, Poles vs Russians, etc. it was kind of idealized in the textbooks, and Zionism was just the Jewish form of that late 1800s trend of nationalism (spurred by horrendous pohgroms in Russian Empire, Arab lands, etc.). 

So through my family I understood the struggle Jews have been through throughout the ages. I thoroughly enjoy understanding how Zionists would meet in European cities and plan the creation of a Jewish state and created funds to buy land in Palestine from Ottomans and Arabs and then from the British as well. And the plans for building the great city - Tel Aviv. All super interesting. I mean it’s a small piece of land, we wanted just half of that piece, and all parties involved seem to believe in the Old Testament, so buying the land and building towns that didn’t exist before should be acceptable to the local population under Ottoman rule. I mean it was going to be around Jerusalem regardless, Jews weren’t gonna build Zion in Alaska, Siberia or Madagascar, that wouldn’t make sense at all to the Zionists. 

In my opinion, I don’t see anything inherently sinister or malevolent about Zionism. And I truly believe there would be no extremists within the Zionists if only the two state solution had been agreed to in 1948 by Palestinians and the Arab league.

They use classic zionists talking points and equate anti zionism to anti semitism. Some even went as far as trying to say zionism any bad and just misrepresented??? They seem to have more sympathy for Israelis because people didn't want a movie being screened there then they do for palestinians. And if you say anything against that country you're accused of either being a performative activist or extremists left or both.

opinion,1c4ccrz,150,,r/IsraelPalestine,"There are two common lines of thinking I see here and in other related subs a lot.

**1)** The first is that Judaism and Zionism are one and the same.  This gets promoted both by some very Zionistic Jews (you can't be Jewish if you aren't 100% pro-Israel) and by some antisemitic antizionists (Israel is bad because Jews are bad, Zionism and Judaism are the same thing). 

I hope it is easy to see why Judaism is not automatically Zionism.  Judaism is thousands of years old.  Zionism is only about 150 years old, a drop in the bucket of Jewish history.  Yes, it's true that there is a kind of \*spiritual\* zionism in the Jewish religion - longing for Jerusalem etc.  But this is very different from the modern political idea of zionism, i.e. that Jews should form a modern nation state in the land of Israel/Palestine.  Many Jews opposed this idea, many Jews even oppose it today, and many other Jews are somewhere in between - maybe not actually opposed to the existence of Israel, but have serious problems with the state as it exists, in its current form.  

There is no requirement anywhere in the Jewish religion to take a particular position on modern day Israel.  In fact, there are sects of Jews who believe it is theologically wrong to support the modern state of Israel in any way (there are theological disagreement about this).   Bottom line: Judaism does not equal Zionism, no matter how lofty your rhetoric or vitriolic your hate.

**2)** There is, however, another myth - the idea that there is a *dichotomy* between Judaism and Zionism, or the idea that Zionists are ""not real Jews,"" or the idea that you're either the good kind of Jew (anti-Zionist) or the bad kind (Zionist).  This always reminds me of the old Chris Rock joke that has become pretty offensive in retrospect - the one about ""two kinds of black people.""  The one racist white people love to recite.

The completely anti-Zionist sects of religious Jews are real.  There are also groups of leftist and (often but not always) secular Jews who are anti-Zionist.  But it is not either/or.  It's not ""real Judaism"" OR zionism.  Whoever came up with that had no understanding of Judaism.  There is a spectrum of positions on Israel in the Jewish community.  There are people who consider themselves, zionist, anti-zionist, even ""post-zionist,"" and there are people who think the word doesn't really mean anything in 2023 when Israel has already been created and has existed as a nation state for 75 years.   There are also people who think Israel should continue to exist generally but also oppose Israel's actions in Gaza and the West Bank. 

**3)** Finally, a word on some of the uses of the word ""Zionist.""  There's a lot of debate around whether the original political philosophy of Zionism was inherently racist, inherently anti-Arab, etc.  I'm not going to get into those, but I want to say a few things that I think are clearly myths about Zionism.  First, Zionism was not created because a bunch of Jews hated Arabs and wanted to travel thousands of miles to oppress them.  Zionism was created to try to solve a problem: the fact that Jews faced rampant persecution in Europe and couldn't live in many of their home countries safely and freely.  You could also tie it to an effort to revitalize Jewish religion, identity, culture and life.   So whether or not you think it had inherent or inevitable racism built in, that was not the point of it.

Relatedly, Zionism is not ""Jewish supremacism.""  Zionism does not say that Jews are better or more valuable than everyone else in the world.  Zionism was a movement to create a Jewish state, period.  It was a form of nationalism, not supremacism.  Irish nationalists did not believe Irish people were better than everyone else in the world, they just wanted an independent Ireland.  Some of the Zionist leaders may in fact have been racist toward Arabs, carrying with them the racist attitudes of their time from Europe.  But there was nothing inherently racist about the idea of creating a Jewish state, and certainly not ""supremacist.""   

Some other things that Zionism is also definitely not -- a plot to control the world, financial domination, a plan to enslave the goyim, a pro-pedophilia cult, etc.  There seem to be a lot of weird conspiracy theories that get dumped into ""Zionism.""  Part of the reason people are wary of antizionism masking antisemitism is because of stuff like this.  

If you actually want to know anything about this stuff, you need to look beyond tiktok and out-of-context quote memes.  The fact that a 25-year-old talks fast about something and very quickly flashes headlines on their screen does not make it the full picture or true.

As a final note: I am not making any of these points in order to advocate a particular position on Gaza, Israel, Palestine, the history, or how things should be resolved.  I just felt the need to rant about the misuses of the term and idea of Zionism.

This post then seemed to embolden some Anti-Semitic commenters, who made some lazy generalisations of the Jewish community, and also ended up attracting some Zionist commenters who wanted to use this specific post (and the actual Anti-Semitic comments) as an opportunity to hate on Arabs, Islam, and Muslims generally.

As many already know (or should surely know by now), Zionists want people to continue conflating Zionism with Judaism so that they can, amongst other things, (1) falsely state that it is “Anti-Semitic” to criticise Israel and / or Zionists, and (2) have people believe Zionists = Jews and vice versa so that when people criticise Israel and / or Zionists, Israel sadistically uses this criticism to keep the memory of very real Jewish suffering alive and have Jews across the globe believe that Israel is Jews’ only real “safe haven”. 

Zionism is a political movement that emerged in the late 19th century. Judaism is around 4,000 years old. They are not one and the same.

Also, there are a number of regulars I’ve often seen while scrolling through this sub., that are Jewish (according to their flairs) and often express Anti-Zionist views too. Jewish Anti-Zionists in particular tend to come to this sub. (and other Middle Eastern subs.) looking for community and belonging, so to my fellow Middle Easterns out there, we should not be alienating our Jewish brothers and sisters. 

And finally, as noted above, when we Arabs and / or Muslims conflate Zionism and Judaism, Zionists then end up chiming in. They love to turn moments like that into some kind of “gotcha” (to falsely spread the idea that Arabs and Muslims generally have some kind of innate hatred of Jews (which is far from true)).

But now due to the war people have really cracked down on comparing zionism to nazism and cancelling anyone who is zionist... why?

What does being a zionist or zionism mean to the west? Does it mean ""person who supports occupation"" ?

The most serious accusation against Israel is that it is a settler colonialist country. I consider it a much more serious accusation than the more common ones like genocide, ethnic cleansing, apartheid, racism, etc. Why? 

Because those are crimes of doing. If you just stop the genocide/apartheid/ethnic cleansing/racism, then everything   else can be solved and there may be peace. But if the country is founded as a settler colonialist project, then that's a crime of being. You are wrong for simply existing in that place that you don't belong. Even an israeli baby born today that never did no harm, he is a criminal in that sense, for just being. The only solution is for the colonialists to leave, like it happened in most countries colonized by europpeans, they simply left and it was the only right thing to do.

Having said that, it is pretty clear that zionism is a colonialist project, exactly like europpean colonialism, except for:

- its nature since its inception as an ethnic and national project, and not an economic project
 
- there is no metropole that benefits from the project, just jews that were disperse in the diaspora and had no political or military power. 

- the vast majority of jews arrived in palestine as refugees, to basically save their lives, and because they had nowhere else to go.

- There is a grounded tradition in judaism, both religiously and culturallly, and it is also a historical fact, that that land is their ancient homeland, ""promised land"". 

Besides all that, it is definately colonialism... Right?

I have heard too many people at this point saying that “the problem isn’t Jews, it’s Zionists.” 

First of all, 6 out of the ~15 million Jews (one of them being my father) are Israeli, and would very much like it for their country to exist. Outside of that, most diaspora Jews care about Israel existing because we know the history of persecution against our people and want Israel to exist not only for religious reasons, but also as a sanctuary for all Jews. Half of the Israeli population are descendants of Jewish refugees from all Arab countries, and just in the ’90s Israel had to and was able to let in 1 million former-Soviet Jewish refugees.

OF COURSE there are non-jews who are antisemitic and use Zionism as a cover for Islamophobia.

OF COURSE there are a few crazy Jewish settlers that continue to steak Palestinians homes deep in the West Bank

OF COURSE the Neturei Karta exist, but they are the minority and the vast majority of Jews are still Zionists.

My point is that just because there are Zionist extremists doesn’t mean that most Zionists are extremists, and that just because there are non-Zionist Jews doesn’t mean that Zionism has nothing to do with Judaism.

then it kind of became obvious that of course a series filled with this recurring theme of displacement and theft and deceit is going to have something to say about israel. but since it's considered more of a third rail topic, they weren't as upfront about it as they were with the us's relationship to tribal lands, gentrification, land ownership, art buyers, ip rights, etc. safdie and fielder are both Jewish, so i'm sure the backlash would be intense from so many different angles, regardless of their take. that also means they probably have very complex and interesting perspectives on zionism.

i think by making whit a gentile that just \*converted\* to Judaism, the show separates her from the actual familial or genetic ties to the ethnicity itself, and can critique zionism through her character without any dangerous antisemitic implications. her visibly decreased interest in the religion throughout the season, and in the marriage that allowed her to convert in the first place, only distances whit from any authentic Jewish identity even farther. so now i'm starting to see her star of david necklace as symbolic of israel the nation, not Judaism the religion.

i still haven't finished rewatching the whole season, but i'm very curious what else i'll pick up on with this new theory. are there certain moments she wears the necklace and others she doesn't? i also remember a scene towards the end where whit's parents bring up her star of david necklace but i can't remember the context.

,18ii9yc,409,,r/IsraelPalestine,"Hello friends, 

  
I find myself deeply intrigued and admittedly a bit perplexed by a topic that has both historical and contemporary significance: the interpretation of anti-Zionism in the context of Israeli and Jewish perspectives, especially in relation to accusations of anti-Semitism.  
As someone of Arab descent, I've been reflecting on the complexities surrounding national and ethnic identity, particularly in relation to political movements. In my own experience, I have encountered diverse views about pan-Arabism and the concept of a union based on ethnicity or religion. This has led me to ponder how similar sentiments are perceived in different cultural and political contexts.  
To this end, I am genuinely interested in understanding the Israeli and Jewish perspectives on this issue. My primary question is: If someone declares that they are anti-Zionist, is this often interpreted as an anti-Semitic statement? What are the underlying reasons for such a perception? I'm seeking to understand the nuances and the historical context that inform these interpretations.  
Additionally, I am curious about the Jewish community's views on nationalism and ethnicity, especially in the context of Israel's unique history and geopolitical situation. How do these perspectives compare or contrast with views on pan-Arabism or other forms of ethnic or religious nationalism?  
I recognize that these topics are sensitive and can evoke strong emotions. My intention is not to provoke or offend, but rather to educate myself and broaden my understanding. I'm particularly interested in hearing from individuals who have personal or academic experience in this area.  
In my quest for knowledge, I'm hoping to gain a more nuanced understanding of these complex issues. Insights, personal experiences, and recommended readings are all greatly appreciated.  
Thank you in advance for your thoughtful responses and for contributing to a respectful and informative discussion.

The occupation and settlements in the West Bank are morally wrong in theory and practice and it harms Israel’s legitimacy as a liberal democracy. They must have to be dismantled. I’m not personally involved in this conflict. I think Netanyahu and the Israeli far-right are detestable people who should not be anywhere near power. Israel has overreacted in its bombing of Gaza and are likely causing more civilian casualties than necessary. The recent strike on WCK workers was a terrible and completely avoidable tragedy, and should be independently investigated. Israel’s recent diplomatic behaviour is very problematic and is actively making peace down the road more difficult.

Anyway, the word “Zionist” has often been conflated by many pro-Palestinian supporters to exclusively mean a far-right version of Zionism and treated as a slur -  people who support ethnically displacing Palestinians - while the word means [the establishment and continued existence of a Jewish nation-state in the Holy Land](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zionism) \- what is now Israel. It is not a fascist ideology. Not all Jews are Zionists, but the majority of them *are* (at least 80%), a vast majority in Israel - similar to how most people in Turkey would support Turkey continuing to exist, as for the Japanese, Turkish, French, etc. To most Israelis and many of their supporters, Zionism just means that Israel should continue to exist, and many would be satisfied with a two-state solution. Many are inherently sympathetic since they learn about it in school. So when someone goes “Nothing against Jews, but *fuck* these Zionist pigs”, Zionist Jews see them as being targeted for what is a common stance around the world. Nothing says Zionism can’t coexist with an independent Palestine, but this common sentiment appears to many eyes, with a large amount of truth, that they want the state of Israel dismantled. 

Now I know many ethnicities, like Scots and Kurds, aren’t afforded their own country, and this argument is often brought up as to why the Jews don't have the right to self-determination. But the fact is that Israel exists *now* and has for 70 years, older than Botswana or Bangladesh, and cultivated a strong civic nationalism. No one talks about collapsing Japan so the Ainu could have a state. While Catalonians protest for independence, there are no serious calls for the destruction of Spain. It is not a common sentiment in Darfur, where a genocide is occurring, for Sudan to be dismantled. Understandably, a lot of Jews and Israelis perceive anti-zionism to be anti-semitism.

Israelis perceive this language as hostile, and in turn they become defensive of Zionism, and some might begin to think there's nothing wrong with the more extreme kind. Israeli has a few nuclear reasons for why it won't ever go down in a fight. 

Those who oppose a two-state solution and want a single state over the area known as Palestine are not in agreement over what should happen to the Jewish population - some say that they can stay while others say they should be expelled (notwithstanding that that would be like Native Americans demanding that hundreds of millions of Americans pack up). In either case it's understandable why the majority of Israelis would not support either solution, given how Jews and other religious/ethnic minorities are treated throughout the Middle East and North Africa. In the face of this, Zionism appears sensible. Ask if a Chinese person would feel if they found China filled with 1.4 billion non-Chinese people, or Yemenis if non-Muslims started making up a majority of the population. Even if nothing in their laws prevents that from happening, these countries would fall into conflict long before it could happen.

,1bhg1cg,135,,r/Jewish,"To me zionism just means you believe Israel has a right to exist. Which is a pretty low bar. But It doesn’t mean you support everything it’s ever said or done. It certainly doesn’t mean you support Netanyahu. I really wish there was a diaspora equivalent of being pro-Labor or similar. 

I know so many Jews who are Zionist, but not pro-Netanyahu and I feel like it would be easier to make our case of there was language around that. Like “I’m a Labor Zionist“ just for example. 

Anyone know of language for that yet? If not, I think we need to coin it. 

Tl;dr I don’t think every Zionist on earth should have to be associated with Netanyahu just because he’s PM. People think he’s an asshole and then they think we’re all assholes. But we’re not and we should be allowed that distinction easily. 

2nd edit: I find it really disappointing how many ppl are so afraid of diaspora Jews articulating our frustration with Netanyahu. Did you think we all had to support him? Are you surprised that we’re mad that Israel hasn’t pushed him out? He has put every one of us at risk for far too long and we have every right to express our displeasure. Clearly that’s very hard for many of you.

Also screw the defeatist “they’ll hate you anyway” attitude. Maybe they will, maybe they won’t. I still have the right to find out. Nor can I “ignore the idiots.” I live in the US where my family and community are at risk every day. I have to try to make it better. I’m not just giving up. 

How disappointing that so many of you are so afraid of clarifying the debate in the diaspora. Jewish debate has been our tradition for literal centuries.

I know this is pretty controversial and a lot of people including people who lean more pro-Israel may disagree.

1. 80-95 percent of Jews are Zionists so are you saying you only hate 80-95 percent of all Jews and are okay with the other 20-5 percent? 

2. Zionism is defined as- supporting the development and continuation of a Jewish nation (in this case yes Israel since it’s the only Jewish nation) how is this wrong? Imagine there was a word for saying you are for the development and continuation of a Muslim nation let’s just use the word “Islamnationism” now imagine a group emerged called “anti-islamnationists” this would be problematic and most people would consider that group Islamophobic. So why is this not the case when it comes to being anti-Zionist? At this point it’s clear anti-Zionism is a front for anti-semitism. Anti-Zionists as a group may not hold antisemitic views but that doesn’t mean being an anti-Zionist isn’t inherently antisemitic. 

3. You cannot change definitions to fit your narrative. Zionism has a definition and most people who consider themselves Zionists base that belief off of the definition and not the one you have personally given to the word. 

4. I guess my point is while not all anti-Zionists are antisemitic anti-Zionism as a whole is inherently antisemitic since you are basically saying you don’t support the existence of a Jewish nation which would be frowned upon when talking about any other religious group so therefore should be discouraged. Instead of labeling yourself an anti-Zionist maybe consider using anti-Israel although I would disagree with you I wouldn’t consider that belief inherently antisemitic just flawed logically.",2024-02-04 05:55:54,Why I believe anti-Zionism is inherently antisemitic,0.55,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1aifu93/why_i_believe_antizionism_is_inherently/
,17ccquc,299,,r/Destiny,"I was scrolling on TikTok and stumbled upon a video, that was uploaded four days ago, that currently has 16 million views, 1.4 million likes, and 57.8K comments. The video showcased houses and residential complexes in Berlin where Jewish people live. Stars of David were painted on the front doors, to signify to the public that Jewish people reside there. This harkening back to Nazi-era tactics of demarcating Jewish residences was due to the rising tensions between Israel and Palestine/Gaza. 

Reasonable comments to this post would likely be something along the lines of ""This is horrible, Jewish civilians should not be targeted because of the actions of the Israeli government"". Instead, the comments with the highest amount of likes just called for the death of Zionists; keep in mind that this was in response to seeing Star's of David being painted on the front doors of Jewish civilians. The comment with the most amount of likes, at 81K, claims that it is ""Zionists"" that are faking these hate crimes, to make it look like they are being harassed.

At what point does the Pro-Palestinian crowd's claim of being anti-Zionism just turn into anti-Semitism? To me, if you're initial reaction to seeing these hate crimes is to immediately call for the deaths of Zionists (in this case, innocent Jewish Berliners), then I find it incredibly difficult to view the Pro-Palestinian movement as having nothing to do with anti-Semitism. I do believe that one could hold anti-Zionist views without being anti-Semitic, but it is high-engagement videos like this that make me believe that a sizeable amount of people (I'm unsure of the proportion) on the Pro-Palestinian side may not be capable of holding both views simultaneously. What are your thoughts on this? Is the line between anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism blurring or is it something else?

Below are the screenshots of the initial post, and the comments with the highest engagement (likes). I can also post the original link to the post if any one would like to view it. I am just not sure if this violates dgg policy. Thank you everyone.

Attached is the example that made me want to type my thoughts out.

The purpose of this joke (from my estimation) is purely to spread anti-semitism through the allusion to Jewish involvement in 9/11. There is no mention of or criticism of the legitimate atrocities committed by the Israeli state, just a connection being drawn between people who speak Hebrew and 9/11.

Given the recent open JQing by people like Musk, Carlson, and Candace Owens, joking about the Jewish people or Israelis being responsible for 9/11 is in no way funny.

The actions of the Israeli state deserve the harshest of condemnation, but using that as an excuse to spread antisemitic conspiracy theories is absolutely unacceptable, and should be called out. 

As anti-Zionists, we need to rise above the notion that Israel in any way acts in the furtherance of Jewish interests, or is reflective of our will.

discussion,1c1n3k1,171,,r/IsraelPalestine,"I posted here twice before, and as I stated then I am a jewish israeli, and a centrist. Due to that position it's hard for me to express my opinions and feelings about this war both irl and online.

The reason I bring up this question is because it's been bothering me for a while now, the way each side seems to have a different meaning for the word. Growing up, the word always meant to symbolize pride in our country and in it's insistance on existing despite all odds throughout history and to the present day. I know that that's not exactly the definition, but I think it's what most israelis believe it means.

Yet, at the same time, the word seems to have a completely different meaning in the global discussion. From a lot of pro-palestinians i get the vibe that when they zionist they're describing someone who's essentially a n*** towards palestinians. Yet, they still apply it to everyone who says they believe israel has a right to exist. Which just seems unfair???

If you asked me if I were a zionist, I'd have to ask you to define it to me first. I obviously support the existance of my country, and I care for it, that would make me a zionist. But I also don't hate palestinians or want the people of gaza to die. Yet that's going to be ignored because I already stated I'm a zionist. 

So to anyone who wants to answer the question at the top:

If you're israeli, what's your definition of the word, and how do you feel about the way it's being used by those on the outside.

If you're not israeli, where do you stand regarding the war and how does that influence the meaning of the word to you?",2024-04-11 18:58:55,What does zionism mean to you?,0.71,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1c1n3k1/what_does_zionism_mean_to_you/

,163jofc,269,,r/IsraelPalestine,"Anti-Zionists have been struggling to get their views inserted into mainstream society, and haven't been successful for a variety of causes. Part of the reason that anti-Zionism is so unpopular, and so often and accurately described as anti-Semitism, is because it’s unprecedented in history. 

Anti-Zionists love to pimp out the Palestinians and claim the reason why they are anti-Zionists is because of the bad things ""Zionism"" has ""done to the Palestinians."" This is a great example of an unprecedented view: Throughout history, many countries have committed horrible, unspeakable atrocities to others. The United States wiped out the Native Americans. The Japanese raped Nanking. The Germans committed the Holocaust and started a world war that killed millions of people. Turkey and the Armenian genocide. Russia and the Holomodor. And the list goes on and on and ON. Anyone with half an education knows that human history is littered with horror.

And yet, in all of that time, at no point were any of the aforementioned countries targeted with an organized movement seeking to remove them from existence. At no point did the UN, the League of Nations, or anyone else say to Germany, for example, “Germany, you committed the Holocaust, therefore your country is no longer allowed to exist. You Germans have lost the right to have your own country.” The worst that ever happened to these countries were condemnations and loss of territory. Of course this isn't counting one country trying to conquer another, because that wasn't an organized activist movement let alone one with self-styled progressive credentials.

Another talking point we hear a lot is ""I don't support Zionism because it happened at the expense of the Palestinians."" Again, the vast majority of countries are created at the expense of someone else, including Palestine itself. The idea that because a country inconvenienced people when it came to exist, and therefore it's okay to remove it from existence, is unprecedented.

The most common example of comparison that anti-Zionists always try to use is the example of apartheid South Africa, and while this comparison is flawed in many, many ways, even the anti-apartheid advocates never wanted South Africa to cease to exist as a state. They just wanted the apartheid laws to be removed. South Africa was not at war with another nation-state, apartheid was an internal issue that needed to be resolved. Palestinian supporters keep trying and arguing that Israel being Jewish is an internal law just like those apartheid laws, and therefore it's fine to change it, is unprecedented too. As Norman Finkelstein has said, third world countries guard their sovereignty jealously, because they know that if the mob comes for Israel today, it could just as easily come for them next.

If anyone has examples of countries that were removed from existence because of bad acts their government did, present them. Ethnic-based nation states remain just as popular as ever today, what with the Palestinians and the Scots advocating for statehood, and I see no reason why Jews and only Jews should be stripped of their state. Anti-Zionists claim to have no knowledge or interest in the existence or conduct of any other ethnic-based nation state other than the Jewish state, and that's a double standard against Jews. There's a reason why so many people think anti-Zionism is anti-Semitism.

Herzl outlines his vision for the state Israel in his book “The Old New Land”. The Hebrew translation for this book is “Tel Aviv”. The city gets its name from this book. It is considered the founding document of the Zionist movement.


The contents of this book is mind blowing in its irony. It is written as a novel. It tells of a Jew and Prussian touring Israel during election season. 


It depicts Israel as a country open to all races, religions and ethnicities. Arabs are equal citizens as Jews. The country has no military because it is friendly with all its neighbors.


Most ironic of all, the main antagonist is a reactionary rabbi called Dr. Geyer who demand that the country belongs exclusively to Jews and starts a political campaign with the aim of stripping non-Jewish citizens of their voting rights. He loses the election in a landslide because all Israelis know that tolerance is the founding principle for this new land.

self,17u41d7,116,,r/Israel,"What we're witnessing right now from the conniving, Jew-bashing 'Free Palestine' mobs and their 'anti-colonialist' rhetoric is a gaslighting campaign of the most epic proportions imaginable, eclipsing even holocaust denial in its brazen slander, falsehood and scope. It both amazes and infuriates me that even on the Pro-Israeli or 'moderate' side, most people are so misinformed on the region's history that they simply take Arab Supremacist propaganda and semantic tricks at face value without fully deconstructing it. 

A lot of those who haven't *extensively* delved into the geopolitical timeline of this territory on our side, not to mention the cynical hypocrites on the other side, think for example that the only counterweight for the Nakba is the exodus of Jews from Arab-ruled nations outside Mandatory Palestine or that the Jewish sovereignty of 2,000 years ago is the *only* reason why Jews had the moral license to immigrate and seek self-determination in British Mandatory Palestine.

We seriously have to stop letting Islamo-fascists and Arab Supremacists ( An ideology dating back to Amin Al-Husseini ) get away with their subversive narrative of events *before Israel's establishment in 1948*. Hamas, PLO fanatics, and their supporters all over the Arab and Western world did not just go too far and do an 'oopsie' to 'fourth-generation Israeli settlers' who 'stole their lands' by killing and kidnapping children. 

Israel proper is not 'their' land, it was not the land of their ancestors *at any point* in history, they are not 'the colonized natives' transposed from American history by ignorant self-centered college students attempting to project their own guilt on Jews. What they truly are is merely *the latest manifestation of a long succession of colonizing, imperialist Arab invaders who have for centuries upon centuries stolen actual indigenous people's lands, butchered them, abused them as second-class citizens and then tried to exterminate us again as soon as we returned to our homeland while screaming bloody murder in a display of sheer hypocrisy*. 

Let's break down all the components of this fraud into their respective parts so you can understand exactly how tangled this web of lies is:

**The conflation of definitions in the term 'Palestinians' and 'Palestine'**

This is a fairly obvious one but still enough to fool the lowest IQ echelons of the Anti-Zionist camp. Today, the moniker 'Palestinian' is colloquially used to refer to inhabitants of the West Bank and Gaza, as well as *exclusively* to Arab citizens of Israel by the global left. In some people's minds, this creates a false dichotomy where, since the title of 'British Mandatory Palestine' or 'Historic Palestine' has the word 'Palestine' in the name, then that retroactively makes everyone called a 'Palestinian' the true inheritor of the land and anyone who is called 'Israeli' or 'Jew' is some kind of foreign intruder.

But that's not what 'Palestinian' meant before 1948, when there weren't any 1967 borders or Israeli-Arabs. It simply meant anyone who lived in Mandatory Palestine and held a Palestinian passport, *including every single Jewish Zionist present there*. As Golda Meir famously said in an interview to a flabbergasted reporter - ""I *am* a Palestinian"". While Jews never really appreciated identifying themselves by the name assigned to the area by Roman colonizers as an insult to their people for self-evident reasons, legally and practically speaking they were completely equivalent to any other Palestinian. Therefore whenever we speak of 'Palestinian', we must distinguish ( As the PLO's own founding charter does and the Arab Higher Committee has done in 1948 ) between *Palestinian-Arabs* and other ethnicities.

""But aha!"" will say the Anti-Zionist, most of them only immigrated to the area in the past 20 or 50 years or whatever, therefore they aren't *real* Palestinians, those filthy immigrants! Don't worry, we'll get to that *incredibly ironic* sentiment from 'Progressive leftists' in a moment.

**The nativity tale of Palestinian-Arabs** 

According to Anti-Zionists and the majority of Arabs, immigrating to historic Palestine from another country or territory and then proceeding to found settlements ( AKA villages, towns ) on it is the most heinous crime imaginable and the core of what it means to be a 'settler-colonialist' nation, especially if you dare to vie for self-determination afterwards too. Unfortunately for them, it seems they only consider it depraved when done by Jews, because that is *precisely* how a huge chunk if not most Palestinian-Arabs found their way into 'Historic Palestine' to begin with, all the way up to 1948.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramallah#Ottoman_era
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nablus#Classical_antiquity
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jund_Filastin#Population
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandatory_Palestine#Jewish_immigration

There have been migration waves of non-Jews and of neighboring individuals into the territory in almost every century since it's been depleted of the bulk of its native Jewish and Samaritan population, some more violent than others, some as literal colonies of foreign empires, and the two biggest Palestinian cities in the West Bank are literally 'colonial settlements' to put it in their terms. In fact, between 1920 and 1948, the British census counted *30k non-Jewish immigrants arriving at the Mandate*. Sure, in this specific period of time, Jewish immigration was much greater, and yet all of those 30k Arabs would automatically be considered 'rightful native land-owners' simply by virtue of their non-Jewishness, and immigration at large is only vile colonialism from 1880 onwards but never beforehand, I wonder why? It's almost as if Arabs are considered inherently superior and more entitled to 'lebensraum' than Jews.

**The 'peaceful co-existence' between Arabs and Jews**

According to Anti-Zionist propaganda, the 'native' Arab-Muslim population has coexisted in absolute harmony with the undesirables such as Jews, Samaritans and others whom they so graciously permitted to live under a dictatorial ethnocentric Arab yoke, until the evil Zionists showed up and ruined everything. But interestingly enough, before the Zionist movement even picked up steam during the times of Ottoman Syria, the region and 'Historic Palestine' in particular experienced a series of massacres committed almost exclusively by Arabs and Muslims, the 'oppressed natives', against 'less-native' minorities such as Jews, Samaritans and Maronite. I was under the impression that Arab Muslims only massacre people out of frustration with colonialism, so I wonder what prompted all of those? Perhaps they were getting too bored with their own colonialism?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_massacres_in_Ottoman_Syria

And then we are told that the only time a Palestinian-Arab ever kills a Jew is because they've been justifiably radicalized by a higher death count among Palestinian-Arabs and subjugation by the IDF, and yet before the IDF or even the Jewish paramilitaries existed, before a single Jew killed a single Arab, Arabs have been committing the very first massacres in Mandatory Palestine since the 1920's, including beheading babies and cutting open pregnant mothers according to the account of the British police superintendent. I guess some things never change.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_killings_and_massacres_in_Mandatory_Palestine

But hey, maybe those Jews simply had it coming? I wonder how *another* ethnic minority which has remained present in tiny numbers on the Land of Israel for thousands of years, the Samaritans, have been faring under the gentle guidance of the Muslim Arab liberators?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samaritans#Ottoman_rule

Hmm, what's that? Massacres and forced conversions, again? Most Samaritans defecting to Israel and joining the IDF after Israel's establishment?? WTF! Why would such an ancient native group which can trace its legacy for longer than most Palestinian-Arabs welcome a  bunch of European settlers as long-lost brothers and willingly participate in the Zionist project?? Don't they know who the REAL natives are? I guess not.

**Arab 'Blood and Soil' entitlement**

You may have heard Anti-Zionists screeching about how 

>""THEY deserve THEIR LAND back!!!"" 
>""How would you feel if someone stole half of YOUR HOUSE out of nowhere?"", 
>""Palestinians want THEIR country back""

THEIR house, THEIR land, THEIR country, who is 'they'? It's not just Palestinians living in the modern Palestinian Territories in the West Bank and Gaza, it clearly doesn't apply to Palestinian Jews because they are the 'land thieves', it doesn't even apply to Mizrahi Jews... hmmm, mysteriously the only demographic being referred to here is *non-Jewish Arabs*, wherever they may be. Don't you know, anyone with Gentile Arab DNA is a 'rightful land owner' between the river and the sea, including those 30k Arab immigrants between 1920 and 1948,  and everyone with Jewish DNA is a land thief, sounds completely historically accurate! So progressive!

And where exactly are those 'Arab lands'? Is it just their actual houses, farms, private property? Hmm, nope. Is it Arab-majority towns and cities? Hmm, wrong again. Oh wait, I know this one - It's that artificial shape drawn by a British pencil on a chunk of the Ottoman Empire which doesn't even align with the administrative borders of Ottoman Syria! That's right, every single piece of uninhabited desert, forest, swamp, hill or plains encompassed by the British line is the ancestral birthright of the Arab race, and the Arab race alone. *The soil itself* will only accommodate Arab blood ( Sounds familiar? ). Why is it all specifically Arab, you asked? Aren't there some Jewish or Samaritan dunes and forests within the British Mandate too somewhere? Well that my friend is an insidious form of Zionist thinking.

You see, the British Empire is both legitimate and illegitimate at the same time, it's a Schrodinger's sovereign. When they draw a bunch of lines on the former Ottoman Empire resulting in a territory which contains an Arab demographic majority, then suddenly all of those Arabs who were previously just provincial residents in a given town or city now 'rightfully own' every other piece of land located inside those lines. They're lucky that the British didn't conquer China and add it to Mandatory Palestine or else those lands would belong to the 'Native Chinese majority', or you could stretch the borders over half of Egypt and claim they should never get independence because ""That's not what the Egyptian native majority of the Mandate wants!"".

But when the British allow for Jewish immigration, just as the Ottomans or Caliphates allowed for Arab immigration, and then take out the pencil to divide the Mandate into two, suddenly the British are no longer legitimate and have no moral authority to draw any boundaries, only Arab monarchs and clerics have the moral authority to do so, yet strangely enough the Mandate borders 'from the river to the sea' magically remain legitimate and everything inside them 'belongs to Arabs'.

Zionism is imperialism and originated from atheist Europeans determined to give Jews their own homeland. Judaism is a monotheistic religion derived from Black people in Africa. In this 1995 clip, Ture argues the two terms are deliberately mixed to make people think they are one of the same thing. As a result, anti-Zionist views get termed anti-Semitic. 

Ture was often accused of popularising anti-Israel sentiment within the Black nationalist movement. He led the All-African People’s Revolutionary Party in the US and was Honorary Prime Minister of the Black Panther Party.

During this time the FBI secretly identified him as the man who would succeed Malcolm X and began a targeted counter-intelligence campaign. That spurred Ture to move to Africa, where he lived in Ghana and then Guinea between 1968-1969. It was there he changed his name from Stokely Standiford Churchill Carmichael and campaigned for revolutionary socialist pan-Africanism. To him, any African who aided and abetted Zionism worked against the interests of Africa.

Ture’s views were direct and uncompromising, as you’ll see from this interview at Howard University.  He died from cancer three years later.",2023-11-28 09:02:22,Ture Masterclass On Zionism ,0.97,907,https://v.redd.it/d8ro078qp13c1

Palestinian here. I believe that zionism have different kinds like culture zionism, religious zionism, political zionism. It's a fact that Theodore hirtzl's zionism was different and had evil beliefs. Even the ones who adopted it after him had more evil beliefs. But  he didn't invent it. But its core and cause was hurt .There was zionism before him. There was also Christian zionism. So it depends on how u interpret this ideology. most of normal zionists nowadays believe zionism is just the right for jews to stay alive and have rights after persecutions that happened to them for thousands of years. I think the invention of zionism was for this cause only. It had no evil beliefs then. I'm not anti THIS zionism .Naom chomsky said that the zionism he believes in is now considered anti-zionism for some zionists. Because it acknowledged the right for jews to have rights and place to live freely but also with Palestinians side by side in peace and coexistence. Because there r zionists who r fundamentalists and extremists that hurt the cause and hurt the Palestinians with it and my family was the victim of it . And there r many of them who r not even jews and some of those r actually antisemitic. They hurt the cause and It made people paint the whole zionism with the same brush. And am anti THIS zionism and I'm not antisemitic. But unfortunately because of these extremists, zionism got a bad reputation. They even cursed some as "" self-hating jews"" just because they don't agree with there zionism because it's extremism and fundamentalism.

 Nowadays

Firstly, Israel has reduced civilian casualties to like 10% of the global average. Frankly, I don’t even know how you claim genocide when Palestinian political leaders are openly obsessed with martyrdom, having their own people slaughtered, and the other side respond with some of the lowest rates of civilian to militant deaths in modern warfare. And prior to this conflict, Palestinian death toll was down to like 200 people per year or something. Like holy fucking shit, that’s practically Auschwitz right? I will also point out here people have been calling Israel nazis for years, so for years we were just dealing with people comparing 200 Palestinians dying per year to the literal holocaust which is so obviously blood libelism I can't.

The death toll for this current conflict is 1/366ths the size that of the Holocaust. Should this current war go on for the same length of the Holocaust (probably won’t), and at the same rate (most likely would), the death toll would still be 1/15th of the size of the Holocaust.

Zionism was a movement to establish a Jewish state. There were different interpretations of what that meant, left wing, right wing, everything in between.

The state has been established. That's it. There is a country with nearly 10 million people, the majority of which were born there and have no other home. It has an education system, a government, a military, science and technology initiatives, an energy network, transportation, tourism, literature, music, cinema, architecture, museum, cuisine, sports. It is a country. It's that simple. Other countries have been formed via far worse cases of ethnic cleansing, genocide, or whatever other buzzword you want to use to simplify Israel's history. 

The use of the term Zionism is a total dogwhistle meant to deny the right of Israel to exist by implying the movement to form it is still active, and thus you can oppose the right of Israel to be an actual country in the first place. You can call its citizens white settler colonists (without any knowledge of the demographics or history). You can call everyone in there a legitimate target for groups that fight against it. You can claim that being born in Israel makes you an evil ideologue, rather than a human being who grew up in a certain place. This language is used by the pro-Palestine movement's loudest spokespeople to literally refer to Jewish children and babies as ""settlers"" who deserved to die on Oct 7 by virtue of where they were born.

discussion,18hkyye,364,,r/IsraelPalestine,"I finally heard someone explain the relationship between anti-Zionism and antisemitism in a way that made it all click. In a November episode of his podcast Call Me Back, Dan Senor interviews Yossi Klein Halevi, author of Letters to my Palestinian Neighbor (among other books). He explained it this way:  
  
Traditionally antisemitism involves hating Jews for our perceived behavior. We killed Jesus, we're greedy capitalists, we're communists trying to undermine capitalism, we encouraged the civil rights movement to destroy White America, et. And because we've always been hated for our perceived behavior, we were always given an out to escape persecution - usually in the form of conversion to Christianity/Islam or face death or exile. But the idea was, just stop doing what makes us hate you and we won't hate you anymore. The one exception was Nazism, which crossed from hating Jews because of what we do into hating us for who we are genetically. We can't change our genetics, so Hitler didn't give us an out. We had to be destroyed.  
  
Anti-Zionism is a return to the pre-Nazi form of antisemitism. We are now hated again for what we do, which is our connection to and support for the evil oppressive Israeli regime. And all we have to do to stop being hated is denounce that connection/support. Then we'll be invited back into the fold of liberal society. That's why anti-Zionists love to claim, ""I don't hate Jews, I just hate Zionists.""  
  
It also helps explain the motivation of leftist anti-Zionist Jews. They are the Jews who have denounced their bad Jew behavior so they can be invited into the club as ""good Jews."" And the reason they work so hard to distance themselves from Zionist Jews is because they don't want to be associated with us for fear of losing their membership in the club.",2023-12-13 17:42:37,Anti-Zionism and antisemitism: Yossi Klein Halevi nails it,0.75,76,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/18hkyye/antizionism_and_antisemitism_yossi_klein_halevi/

Of course, this is nonsense, since anti-zionism stems from opposition to the colonisation of Palestine, the genocide of its native population and the ongoing apartheid, but Israel and its supporters peddle this absurd narrative nonetheless to try to shield their state from even the slightest criticism. Here I will argue that not only is this not true, I would argue the opposite, that Zionism is a form of antisemitism. 

&nbsp;


- **Zionism is the worst reaction possible to antisemitism**

I won't explain the entire history of Zionism here, but I think it’s important to first acknowledge that Zionism exists at least in part as a reaction to antisemitism in Europe. Theodore Herzl founded the World Zionist Congress in 1896, two years after the Dreyfus affair which took place in 1894, and there were still pogroms happening at the time, like the Kishinev pogrom which took place in 1903. I can certainly sympathise with European Jews looking for safety. 

But Zionism is simply the worst reaction possible to antisemitism, since instead of fighting antisemitism, Zionists embraced antisemitic rhetoric, allied with antisemites, embraced other violent ideologies like colonialism and imperialism, and inflicted on the indigenous Palestinians conditions similar to that which they were victims of in Europe. 

&nbsp;

- **Zionists embraced antisemitic rhetoric.**

Zionists often accuse anti zionist Jews of being “self-hating”, but in reality it is the opposite, Zionists embraced and internalised antisemitic rhetoric. Theodore Herzl, founding father of political Zionism, believed that there were two types of Jews, Jiden (Yids) and Juden (Jews). He considered any Jew who openly opposed his proposals for a Zionist solution to the Jewish question to be a Yid or Mauschel, a ""bad Jew"" as opposed to a ""virtuous Jew"" . In 1897, he wrote an article titled “[Mauschel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herzl%27s_Mauschel_and_Zionist_antisemitism)”. This article is nothing but an antisemitic rant, in which Herzl repeats one antisemitic trope after another : 

>**We've known him for a long time, and just merely to look at him, let alone approach or, heaven forbid, touch him was enough to make us feel sick. But our disgust, until now, was moderated by pity; we sought extenuating, historical explanations for his being so crooked, sleazy, and a shabby  specimen**. Moreover, we told ourselves that he was, after all, our fellow tribesman, though we had no cause to be proud of his fellowship . . . . who is this Yid, anyway? A type, my dear friends, a figure that pops up time and again, the dreadful companion of the Jew, and so inseparable from him that they have always been mistaken for one for the other. The Jew is a human being like any other, no better and no worse …. **The Yid, on the other hand, is a hideous distortion of the human character, something unspeakably low and repulsive.**


Herzl wasn’t the only Zionist using antisemitic rhetoric to talk about Jews who didn’t support Zionism. Vladimir Jabotinksy, another Zionist leader also used a similar antisemitic rhetoric, writing:

>Our starting point is to take the typical Yid of today and to imagine his diametrical opposite ... because **the Yid is ugly, sickly, and lacks decorum**, we shall endow the ideal image of the Hebrew with masculine beauty. **The Yid is trodden upon and easily frightened** and, therefore, the Hebrew ought to be proud and independent. **The Yid is despised by all** and, therefore, the Hebrew ought to charm all. **The Yid has accepted submission** and, therefore, the Hebrew ought to learn how to command. **The Yid wants to conceal his identity from strangers** and, therefore, the Hebrew should look the world straight in the eye and declare: ""I am a Hebrew!""

S. H. Landau, founder of Hapoel Hamizrachi, the religious Labor movement that gave rise to the National Religious Party, the ancestor of the National Religious Party–Religious Zionism of Bezalel Smotrich, wrote : 

> Israel in exile ceased to be a nation or, to be exact, a living nation.... **A people lacking a land of their own whose natural life force has dried up is not a nation. Parasitism, conscious or unconscious, becomes its second nature**—parasitism of the individual and of the community.

David Ben-Gurion, first Prime Minister of Israel  said: 

> Since our last national tragedy—the suppression of the Bar Kochba rebellion by the Romans—we have had ""histories"" of persecution, of legal discrimination, of the Inquisition and the pogroms, of dedication and martyrdom, **but we did not have Jewish history anymore**, because a history of a people is only what the people create as a whole, as a national unit, and not the sum total of what happens to individuals and to groups within the people. For the last fifteen hundred years, we have been excluded from world history, which is made up of the histories of nations.

That’s right, all the great Jewish thinkers like [Moses Maimonides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maimonides) or [Baruch Spinoza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baruch_Spinoza), all the vibrant cultural and religious life of the Jewish communities of the last 2000 years were not part of history according to Ben Gurion, simply because the Jewish people did not have a nation state. 

This is not just a part of the history of Zionism, you still see this rhetoric to this day in Israel. Popular Israeli tech blogger Hilel Fuld [tweeted](https://twitter.com/HilzFuld/status/1739929860141642169) recently :
>It occured to me recently that despite the Jews finally being able to stand up for ourselves, so many Jews are still apologetic. Just to sum this up in the clearest and most unequivocal way : **The weak Jew was led to the gas chambers. That Jew was left behind and now there is a new Jew**. This new Jew has F16 fighter jets and Merkava tanks. This Jew ain't gonna take your crap.

So according to Zionists, Jewish people are “crooked, sleazy, unspeakably low and repulsive (Herzl), parasites (S.H. Landau), have no history (Ben Gurion), and holocaust victims were “weak”. The way Zionist describe Jews, particularly those who oppose Zionism, is of course extremely antisemitic and not different from antisemitism from say European fascists. 
 
&nbsp;

- **Zionists have always allied with antisemites, at the expense of other Jews**

Zionists have always tried  to ally with antisemites to further their project, at the expense of other Jews. Holocaust survivor and historian Israel Shahak says that Zionism is “is both a reaction to antisemitism and **a conservative alliance with it**“.

Indeed, from the start, Zionists sought to ally with antisemites. Theodore Herzl wrote in his diaries that “the anti-Semites will become our most dependable friends, the anti-Semitic countries our allies”. Herzl allied himself with the notorious Count von Plehve, the antisemitic minister of Tsar Nicholas. After the barbaric Kishinev pogrom of April 1901, when hundreds of Jews were killed and wounded, Herzl came to Russia to barter with V.K. Plehve, the Russian interior minister who had incited the pogrom. Herzl told Jewish cultural leader Chaim Zhitlovsky: “I have an absolutely binding promise from Plehve that he will procure a charter for Palestine for us in 15 years at the outside. There is one condition, however, the revolutionaries must stop their struggle against the Russian government.” Herzl was fine with impeding the efforts of Russian Jews to get their rights if it meant support for the Zionist project.

Antisemitism was also one of the motives behind the Balfour declaration. Arthur James Balfour saw the declaration as a way to divert Jewish immigration away from the UK and towards Palestine. In 1919, he said he hoped that the declaration would ""mitigate the age-long miseries created for Western civilization by the presence in its midst of a Body which it too long regarded as alian and even hostile, but which it was equally unable to expel or to absord.” He concludes :  “Surely, for this if for no other reason, it should receive our support.”

Similarly, Vladimir Jabotinsky made a pact with Petlyura, which promoted the formation of Jewish self-defense units in the Petliura army during the Russia civil war.  The same Petlyura whose forces massacred some 100,000 Jews in 1918-21. 

Some Zionists leaders in Germany even celebrated when Hitler and the Nazis came to power in 1933, because they shared their beliefs in the primacy of 'race' and his hostility to the assimilation of Jews among 'Aryans'. They congratulated Hitler on his triumph over the common enemy - the forces of liberalism. Dr Joachim Prinz, a zionist rabbi, wrote in his book ""Wir Juden"" in 1934 :

> The meaning of the German Revolution for the German nation will eventually be clear to those who have created it and formed its image. Its meaning for us must be set forth here: the fortunes of liberalism are lost. The only form of political life which has helped Jewish assimilation is sunk. [...] We want assimilation to be replaced by a new law: the declaration of belonging to the Jewish nation and Jewish race. **A state build upon the principle of the purity of nation and race can only honoured and respected by a Jew who declares his belonging to his own kind**.

This is an ongoing tradition, current Israeli leaders also seek to ally with antisemites to further the Zionist project. Benjamin Netanyahu [is very close](https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/02/24/why-benjamin-netanyahu-loves-the-european-far-right-orban-kaczynski-pis-fidesz-visegrad-likud-antisemitism-hungary-poland-illiberalism/) to Hungary’s Viktor Orban, who has repeatedly spread [antisemitic conspiracy theories](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/18/hungarian-government-viktor-orban-campaign-renews-antisemitism-concerns) about George Soros and Jews ruling the world. 

&nbsp;

- **Antisemites love Israel**

As I have shown, Zionists have sought to ally with antisemites to further their objectives. It might seem contradictory at first, but antisemites also love Israel back. This is due to the following two reasons : 

First, antisemites obviously hate Jewish people, and they are happy to see them leave their society and move to Israel. 

Second, they see Israel as a model for the type of ethnostate they want to build, where white supremacy is enshrined in the constitution and minorities don’t get equal rights.

There are so many examples of far right antisemites supporting Israel for these reasons. 

[Tommy Robinson](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/nov/27/jewish-antisemitism-support-israel-gaza-zionism), a leading member of the British far right, recently called on people to go to the Cenotaph, a war memorial in central London, to “protect” it from pro-Palestinian protesters.  [Richard Spencer](https://www.timesofisrael.com/white-nationalist-richard-spencer-tells-israelis-that-jews-are-over-represented/), a leading member of the American far right, describes himself as a ‘white Zionist,’ saying he wants a secure homeland for ‘my people’ like the Jews have in Israel; 

[Viktor Orban](https://balkaninsight.com/2023/11/14/the-roots-of-orbans-strong-bond-with-israel-and-its-pm/) has shown his support for Israel, so has [the AFD in Germany](https://www.timesofisrael.com/loathed-by-jews-germanys-far-right-afd-loves-the-jewish-state/) and Marine Lepen’s Front National in France. I have already mentioned the antisemitic conspiracy of Orban about Soros above.

The founder of the Front National, Jean-Marie Lepen, is a [Holocaust denier](https://www.dw.com/en/frances-far-right-jean-marie-le-pen-convicted-for-holocaust-denial/a-19168158), who says that the gas chambers were just “a detail of the war”.

In November 2023, Elon Musk, agreed with a post on Twitter that said Jewish people have been pushing “dialectical hatred against whites”. The same month,[ he visited Israel to show his support](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/elon-musk-israel-propaganda-that-begets-murder-must-be-stopped-2023-11-27/) and “push back against that is convincing people to engage in, you know, murder"".

US pastor John Hagee is a fervent supporter of Israel. [He was invited](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/11/17/israel-gaza-march-john-hagee/) to speak in November 2023 to an audience of thousands at the March for Israel in Washington, organised by the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, to help “condemn the rising trend of antisemitic violence”. In 2008, [he claimed](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/nationally-prominent-evan_b_249279) that Adolf Hitler had been born from a lineage of “accursed, genocidally murderous half-breed Jews” and sent by God to help the Jews reach the promised land. 

US presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr propagated the antisemitic conspiracy theory that Covid-19 was ""[targeted to spare Jewish people](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/15/us/politics/rfk-jr-remarks-covid.html)"". When he was accused of propagating antisemitism, which he denies, Kennedy chose to blast representatives like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez for insufficient support of Israel, saying that “criticism of Israel is a false narrative” and “Israel is a shining star on human rights in the Middle East”.

&nbsp;

- **Conclusion**

Far from being a “self-determination” project for Jewish people like Zionists describe it, Zionism in itself is an antisemitic project. Instead of pushing back against antisemitism, Zionists chose to embrace it. Zionist leaders internalised antisemitic rhetoric and used it against other Jews. They share with antisemites the idea that Jews and other peoples can’t live together. They have historically sought to ally with antisemites to further their goal, and antisemites also love Israel. For all these reasons, the Zionist project is antisemitic, and it has been a powerful driver of antisemitism for the last 120 years.",2024-04-18 09:32:31,"Zionism, a form of antisemitism",0.21,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1c6yapr/zionism_a_form_of_antisemitism/

self,186cz5q,138,,r/Israel,"1. It denies the right of Jews to self-determination to which other nations, on their ancestral land, are considered to be entitled, when Zionism is the only way to keep Jews away from hostile Europeans having inflicted on them centuries of genocides that culminated in the Holocaust. It is a form of demonisation worse than simply seeing Jews as *greedy money lenders*
2. Antisemites comfortably replace ""Jews"" with ""Zionists"" in recycling hateful ancient conspiracy theories about Jews to masquerade it as *criticism* of Israel – the only Jewish state in the world. Antisemites comfortably attack Jews in disguise of protesting the actions of Israel. Any antisemitic hate crimes can be easily denied as an expression of ""anti-Zionism"" rather than have its dangerous nature acknowledged with reference to history and appropriately condemned. Never have antisemitic hate crimes been so legitimised in modern history than now
3. Are you able to find an ""anti-Zionist"" who has never uttered a single word of vitriol that does not cross the boundary into antisemitism? Are you able to find a Zionist who spent or has spent their life demonising Israel and the Jewish nation it embodies?

opinion,1an8co9,426,,r/IsraelPalestine,"A substantial number of people on the internet kick, cry, and scream when someone provides any evidence that Ashkenazi Jews have plenty of ancestry that goes back to the Levant, and are largely Mediterranean in profile. This has been backed up by practically all reputable studies and the only ""argument"" that people with the opposite opinion have is ""WELL THEY LOOK WHITE"". That in itself doesn't say much, phenotype is subjective and can change due to things like founder effects. It's a deeply childish and unscientific way to determine origin. The science has been clear for a while about a Levantine origin for most of the world's Jewish populations, including Ashkenazim.

None of that has very much bearing on whether or not what Israel is doing right now is good or whether the Zionist project was a good idea to implement. You could simply be stating it as a matter of fact as opposed to justifying Zionism but people will not care. They need the white colonizer narrative to be real because they want to think they're fighting the French in Algeria or the Dutch in South Africa. 

It's also become fashionable for another reason-namely that there's the well-known meme of the white person in America claiming to be part native/Cherokee when they're not.

Now, 75-years later after the establishment of the state of Israel, isn’t saying you are “Anti-Zionist” another veiled way of saying you are against the existence of the State of Israel?

,186gyop,142,,r/samharris,"I’m trying to understand the differences between antisemitism and anti-Zionism. I’m hearing statements like “I found out my professor was a closet Zionist and I am so disappointed” or “so and so needs to be cancelled cause she’s a Zionist.” These ppl will always bite back and deny that they are antisemitic. I understand that they may not see themselves that way b/c they don’t hate all Jewish ppl, may have Jewish friends in their countries, etc. It IS different than straight up anti-Jewish hate. 

But I also see anti-Zionism as distinct from criticizing Israel for specific actions and those affects on Palestine and Palestinian people; anti-Zionism existed before Israel did. It’s the idea that Israel or Zionism is uniquely evil that I struggle with. 

Israel is surrounded by Arab Muslim countries, many in which you will be killed for rejecting Islam. It’s why there is a large “ex-Muslim” community in the West, and danger associated with this movement. Anti-Zionists would support other countries having national pride, a specific religion, culture, flags. You would be called racist or xenophobic for claiming they shouldn’t. But it’s not like Israel is the only country that has caused suffering for Muslim ppl or behaved like “colonizers,” with a will to power and wealth. Not historically and not today. 

So why is Zionism taboo? Is it because they are much worse to Palestinian people than Muslim-majority countries are to their own people? Or is it worse because they “don’t belong there” in the first place (though they were expelled historically too), are a different religion, white-er? Would more ppl march against Russia if Ukrainians didn’t look like Russians? Ppl are far angrier about Israel than Russia and that seems morally inconsistent. 

They can say “no, ISIS is just as bad,” for example, but the world reaction proves otherwise. I do not believe that hundreds of thousands of ppl just care about Palestinians specifically when Muslim women have been suffering horrifically for years, for example. They have unique hatred for Israel and I’m trying to understand. I believe reasonable distinctions b/w these concepts can be made, but making comments like I mentioned above with no nuance seem intuitively antisemitic to me (while also maintaining plausible deniability.)

Former Harris podcast guest, Masha Gessen, wins the Hannah Arendt prize for political thought. Then the award ceremony is cancelled after she writes an article critical of Israel's prosecution of the war in Gaza. (The ceremony is going to be rescheduled after organisers withdrew from the planned event, citing her criticism of Israel).

Yes, it's kind of trivial in the big scheme of things, but if you're been following the news in Germany, you'd know that there's a taboo around criticism of Israel more generally these days.

The irony, of course, is that Arendt herself was critical of Zionism. She wrote extensively why Zionism was a bad idea. Here's a quote by Arendt:

>after the war it turned out that the Jewish question, which was considered the only insoluble one, was indeed solved – namely, by means of a colonised and then conquered territory – but this solved neither the problem of the minorities nor the stateless. On the contrary, like virtually all other events of the 20th century, the solution of the Jewish question merely produced a new category of refugees, the Arabs, thereby increasing the number of stateless and rightless by another 700,000 to 800,000 people. And what happened in Palestine within the smallest territory and in terms of hundreds of thousands was then repeated in India on a large scale involving many millions of people.

I generally consider myself liberal and a lot of the people I hang out with are pretty far left. Generally the air of it is understanding and equality, but I've noticed a bit of a double standard. I'll give some examples. 

A man cant tell a woman what having a period or being pregnant is like, there's no way for them to know and it's considered bad form. 

A white person can't tell a black person what it's like to be black or what to or not to be offended by as they couldn't possibly know

But for some reason when it comes to anti semitism it seems to be up to everyone else's interpretation other than jews. 
On top of this I've noticed an (anecdotal) average of 8,9/10 people stating anti zionist sympathies seem to entirely connect it to the Jewish people. 
I live in a very Jewish neighborhood the the US. For a few weeks after Oct 7th religious jews we're being beat up in my area. The irony is most of that sect of jews doesn't support Israel, but they get lynched anyway. 
Why don't the speakers on the left take responsibility for the rhetoric and show the differences between anti semitism and zionism? I have looked a bit but have not found any videos from pro Palestinians telling their followers not to conflate jews and zionist. 

I guess there's no one clear question here. But I think it opens up a lot of good discussion points. I look forward to checking up on this dumpster fire in a few hours if I'm still up after this cleaning I've been putting off. Happy conversing!

discussion,19e6uq6,28,,r/JewsOfConscience,"I am an anti-Zionist and have been ever since I started to learn actual history, some twenty years ago. Growing up a secular Jew in the American South I experienced different kinds of anti-Semitism firsthand, which led me to a kind of naive solace in the existence of Israel. I read an article by Reconstructionist Rabbi Rebecca Alpert several months ago that called for Reconstructionism to revisit Zionism, specifically ""we must resolve the tension between the daily realities of Israel and the Zion of our dreams.""

So what could such a resolution look like? I've never felt it enough to say only what I am against. I am anti-racist, sure, and also I work for a pluralist society that celebrates diversity. I am anti-capitalist and also I am a libertarian socialist.

For Jews especially, is it enough to be anti-Zionist? What about Diasporism? I am still early in my readings on the concept, but it seems pretty straightforward: a positive belief in the importance of Judaism as a worldwide religion and Jewish people as an evolving shared peoplehood. (I'm partial to Kaplan's summation, a transnational transethnic peoplehood.)

I will always love and be a part of כלל ישראל. But we do not need to be constrained to ארץ ישראל. And I am of the opinion that מדינה ישראל is a threat to Jewish safety and the world at large as it exists currently, the logical conclusion of the consolidation of Zionism(s) into an ethnonationalist settler-colonial project. ""The logic of the annihilation of the native,"" as Ilan Pappé contextualizes it.

What points of unity could define Diasporism? How would it change our liturgies, our practices, our cultures? Instead of ""next year in Jerusalem"" is it ""Next year in every country?"" Is the age of the third temple how we make a temple out of our homes? Every Jew a rabbi, or better yet a kohen/kohanah? That all might be a little too out there, even for me.

The Bund and other Jewish Labor groups had a wonderful secular response to early Zionism: Our Homeland is Where We Live. What if that infused and evolved our religious practices?

PostFlairPol,1b7deym,123,,r/lonerbox,"I feel like there are a few perceptions floating around. Oftentimes it's probably an inconsequential distinction and serves more as a signal for the network of ideas to which someone subscribes. It's just the sort of label (like genocide, ethnic cleansing, terrorist) that will be used by one one of two groups:  


\- Tribal twitterheads using it hysterically, to outsource a sense of virtue and identity without engaging in actual argument.  


\- Good faith and actually knowledgeable interlocutors who actually don't place any weight on the term per se, but just use it as it's supposed to be used: to capture or represent all the much more nuanced information that defines it.  


There probably isn't much overlap between these groups, so maybe it's once again not important. Maybe my question would just lead to a discussion as to what early zionists were ACTUALLY trying to do. But that's not my question. Moreso I'm trying to get a grasp for what most people think they mean when referring to zionism in modern discussions.  


Does that make sense? I feel like I just wrote four times as much as I needed to for a relatively simple question. Still, I feel like at the bottom there are some significant points of disagreement that people should note. If someone goes on Piers Morgan and says ""what we protest is not Judaism or even Israel, it is Zionism"" then they just have a fundamentally different idea of zionism than many people I know. But then there certainly are ultraorthodox demographics who view themselves as the only true 'zionists,' and even the idea of any state as anathema. Obviously there were the various forms of early zionism (labor, religious, whatever) and then those evolved and now people use the term in reference to various collections of activities and ideas. Most of the time I (American, living the last 8 years in Europe and Middle East) hear the term it's from arabs or left-leaning westerners, and it's used synonymously with things like 'apartheid' or 'ethno-nationalism' or 'expansionism,' depending.  


But there are other definitions of Zionism. Some think it means the justification of settlements specifically in former Judaea/Samaria. Some think it means the right to statehood/self-determination of Jews, and the right of return to that general region. Some include religious or ethnic exclusivity, some don't. It gets a bit tricky, but it seems to me like describing someone as a zionist (or self-associating as one) either:

A) shouldn't imply immorality or negativity; or

B) shouldn't include someone believing Israel has the right to exist  


A bit more, just for those with time:  


Given Israel's current existence and location, I think it's silly to propose that Jews should have their self-determination elsewhere. I'll note that early zionists even considered other parts of the world. Actually (just anecdotally) a lot of Palestinians and Egyptians I've known always refer to ideas of a Jewish state in either Argentina or Nevada, and suggest that either would have been a far more sensible location.  


Perhaps. That's certainly a discussion to be had. In my view it doesn't give anyone the right to reject Israel as it currently exists––and that's usually (always) where those sentiments lead, in my experience.

,18hi8ji,99,,r/Jewish,"I finally heard someone explain the relationship between anti-Zionism and antisemitism in a way that made it all click. In a November episode of his podcast Call Me Back, Dan Senor interviews Yossi Klein Halevi, author of Letters to my Palestinian Neighbor (among other books). He explained it this way:

Traditionally antisemitism involves hating Jews for our perceived behavior. We killed Jesus, we're greedy capitalists, we're communists trying to undermine capitalism, we encouraged the civil rights movement to destroy White America, et. And because we've always been hated for our perceived behavior, we were always given an out to escape persecution - usually in the form of conversion to Christianity/Islam or face death or exile. But the idea was, just stop doing what makes us hate you and we won't hate you anymore. The one exception was Nazism, which crossed from hating Jews because of what we do into hating us for who we are genetically. We can't change our genetics, so Hitler didn't give us an out. We had to be destroyed.

Anti-Zionism is a return to the pre-Nazi form of antisemitism. We are now hated again for what we do, which is our connection to and support for the evil oppressive Israeli regime. And all we have to do to stop being hated is denounce that connection/support. Then we'll be invited back into the fold of liberal society. That's why anti-Zionists love to claim, ""I don't hate Jews, I just hate Zionists."" 

It also helps explain the motivation of leftist anti-Zionist Jews. They are the Jews who have denounced their bad Jew behavior so they can be invited into the club as ""good Jews."" And the reason they work so hard to distance themselves from Zionist Jews is because they don't want to be associated with us for fear of losing their membership in the club.

,1c6y4qj,29,,r/BadHasbara,"Israel and its lobby organisations like [the ADL](https://www.adl.org/about/adl-and-israel/anti-israel-and-anti-zionist-campaigns) or [the World Jewish Congress](https://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/anti-zionism) will often claim that “anti-zionism is a form of anti-semitism”. Of course, this is nonsense, since for the most part, anti-zionism stems from opposition to the colonisation of Palestine, the genocide of its native population and the ongoing apartheid, but Israel and its supporters peddle this absurd narrative nonetheless to try to shield their state from even the slightest criticism. Here I will argue that not only is this not true, I would argue the opposite, that Zionism is a form of antisemitism. 

&nbsp;


- **Zionism is the worst reaction possible to antisemitism**

I won't explain the entire history of Zionism here, but I think it’s important to first acknowledge that Zionism exists at least in part as a reaction to antisemitism in Europe. Theodore Herzl founded the World Zionist Congress in 1896, two years after the Dreyfus affair which took place in 1894, and there were still pogroms happening at the time, like the Kishinev pogrom which took place in 1903. I can certainly sympathise with European Jews looking for safety. 

But Zionism is simply the worst reaction possible to antisemitism, since instead of fighting antisemitism, Zionists embraced antisemitic rhetoric, allied with antisemites, embraced other violent ideologies like colonialism and imperialism, and inflicted on the indigenous Palestinians conditions similar to that which they were victims of in Europe. 

&nbsp;

- **Zionists embraced antisemitic rhetoric.**

Zionists often accuse anti zionist Jews of being “self-hating”, but in reality it is the opposite, Zionists embraced and internalised antisemitic rhetoric. Theodore Herzl, founding father of political Zionism, believed that there were two types of Jews, Jiden (Yids) and Juden (Jews). He considered any Jew who openly opposed his proposals for a Zionist solution to the Jewish question to be a Yid or Mauschel, a ""bad Jew"" as opposed to a ""virtuous Jew"" . In 1897, he wrote an article titled “[Mauschel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herzl%27s_Mauschel_and_Zionist_antisemitism)”. This article is nothing but an antisemitic rant, in which Herzl repeats one antisemitic trope after another : 

>**We've known him for a long time, and just merely to look at him, let alone approach or, heaven forbid, touch him was enough to make us feel sick. But our disgust, until now, was moderated by pity; we sought extenuating, historical explanations for his being so crooked, sleazy, and a shabby  specimen**. Moreover, we told ourselves that he was, after all, our fellow tribesman, though we had no cause to be proud of his fellowship . . . . who is this Yid, anyway? A type, my dear friends, a figure that pops up time and again, the dreadful companion of the Jew, and so inseparable from him that they have always been mistaken for one for the other. The Jew is a human being like any other, no better and no worse …. **The Yid, on the other hand, is a hideous distortion of the human character, something unspeakably low and repulsive.**


Herzl wasn’t the only Zionist using antisemitic rhetoric to talk about Jews who didn’t support Zionism. Vladimir Jabotinksy, another Zionist leader also used a similar antisemitic rhetoric, writing:

>Our starting point is to take the typical Yid of today and to imagine his diametrical opposite ... because **the Yid is ugly, sickly, and lacks decorum**, we shall endow the ideal image of the Hebrew with masculine beauty. **The Yid is trodden upon and easily frightened** and, therefore, the Hebrew ought to be proud and independent. **The Yid is despised by all** and, therefore, the Hebrew ought to charm all. **The Yid has accepted submission** and, therefore, the Hebrew ought to learn how to command. **The Yid wants to conceal his identity from strangers** and, therefore, the Hebrew should look the world straight in the eye and declare: ""I am a Hebrew!""

S. H. Landau, founder of Hapoel Hamizrachi, the religious Labor movement that gave rise to the National Religious Party, the ancestor of the National Religious Party–Religious Zionism of Bezalel Smotrich, wrote : 

> Israel in exile ceased to be a nation or, to be exact, a living nation.... **A people lacking a land of their own whose natural life force has dried up is not a nation. Parasitism, conscious or unconscious, becomes its second nature**—parasitism of the individual and of the community.

David Ben-Gurion, first Prime Minister of Israel  said: 

> Since our last national tragedy—the suppression of the Bar Kochba rebellion by the Romans—we have had ""histories"" of persecution, of legal discrimination, of the Inquisition and the pogroms, of dedication and martyrdom, **but we did not have Jewish history anymore**, because a history of a people is only what the people create as a whole, as a national unit, and not the sum total of what happens to individuals and to groups within the people. For the last fifteen hundred years, we have been excluded from world history, which is made up of the histories of nations.

That’s right, all the great Jewish thinkers like [Moses Maimonides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maimonides) or [Baruch Spinoza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baruch_Spinoza), all the vibrant cultural and religious life of the Jewish communities of the last 2000 years were not part of history according to Ben Gurion, simply because the Jewish people did not have a nation state. 

This is not just a part of the history of Zionism, you still see this rhetoric to this day in Israel. Popular Israeli tech blogger Hilel Fuld [tweeted](https://twitter.com/HilzFuld/status/1739929860141642169) recently :
>It occured to me recently that despite the Jews finally being able to stand up for ourselves, so many Jews are still apologetic. Just to sum this up in the clearest and most unequivocal way : **The weak Jew was led to the gas chambers. That Jew was left behind and now there is a new Jew**. This new Jew has F16 fighter jets and Merkava tanks. This Jew ain't gonna take your crap.

So according to Zionists, Jewish people are “crooked, sleazy, unspeakably low and repulsive (Herzl), parasites (S.H. Landau), have no history (Ben Gurion), and holocaust victims were “weak”. The way Zionist describe Jews, particularly those who oppose Zionism, is of course extremely antisemitic and not different from antisemitism from say European fascists. 
 
&nbsp;

- **Zionists have always allied with antisemites, at the expense of other Jews**

Zionists have always tried  to ally with antisemites to further their project, at the expense of other Jews. Holocaust survivor and historian Israel Shahak wrote in his 1994 book *Jewish History, Jewish Religion* that Zionism is “both a reaction to antisemitism and **a conservative alliance with it**“.

Indeed, from the start, Zionists sought to ally with antisemites. Theodore Herzl wrote in his diaries that “the anti-Semites will become our most dependable friends, the anti-Semitic countries our allies”. Herzl allied himself with the notorious Count von Plehve, the antisemitic minister of Tsar Nicholas. After the barbaric Kishinev pogrom of April 1901, when hundreds of Jews were killed and wounded, Herzl came to Russia to barter with V.K. Plehve, the Russian interior minister who had incited the pogrom. Herzl told Jewish cultural leader Chaim Zhitlovsky: “I have an absolutely binding promise from Plehve that he will procure a charter for Palestine for us in 15 years at the outside. There is one condition, however, the revolutionaries must stop their struggle against the Russian government.” Herzl was fine with impeding the efforts of Russian Jews to get their rights if it meant support for the Zionist project.

Antisemitism was also one of the motives behind the Balfour declaration. Arthur James Balfour saw the declaration as a way to divert Jewish immigration away from the UK and towards Palestine. In 1919, he said he hoped that the declaration would ""mitigate the age-long miseries created for Western civilization by the presence in its midst of a Body which it too long regarded as alian and even hostile, but which it was equally unable to expel or to absord.” He concludes :  “Surely, for this if for no other reason, it should receive our support.”

Similarly, Vladimir Jabotinsky made a pact with Petlyura, which promoted the formation of Jewish self-defense units in the Petliura army during the Russia civil war.  The same Petlyura whose forces massacred some 100,000 Jews in 1918-21. 

Some Zionists leaders in Germany even celebrated when Hitler and the Nazis came to power in 1933, because they shared their beliefs in the primacy of 'race' and his hostility to the assimilation of Jews among 'Aryans'. They congratulated Hitler on his triumph over the common enemy - the forces of liberalism. Dr Joachim Prinz, a zionist rabbi, wrote in his book ""Wir Juden"" in 1934 :

> The meaning of the German Revolution for the German nation will eventually be clear to those who have created it and formed its image. Its meaning for us must be set forth here: the fortunes of liberalism are lost. The only form of political life which has helped Jewish assimilation is sunk. [...] We want assimilation to be replaced by a new law: the declaration of belonging to the Jewish nation and Jewish race. **A state build upon the principle of the purity of nation and race can only honoured and respected by a Jew who declares his belonging to his own kind**.

In the early 1930s, Nazi Germany sought to make life impossible for Jews. Some Zionist leaders sought to collaborate with the Nazis, negotiating [the 1933 Haavara Agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haavara_Agreement) between Nazi Germany and Zionist German Jews signed on 25 August 1933, which facilitated the migration of approximately 60,000 German Jews to Palestine between 1933 and 1939. 

This is an ongoing tradition, current Israeli leaders also seek to ally with antisemites to further the Zionist project.

- **Antisemites love Israel**

As I have shown, Zionists have sought to ally with antisemites to further their goals. It might seem contradictory at first, but antisemites also love Israel back. This is due to the following two reasons : 

First, antisemites obviously hate Jewish people, and they are happy to see them leave their society and move to Israel. 

Second, they see Israel as a model for the type of ethnostate they want to build, where white supremacy is enshrined in the constitution and minorities don’t get equal rights.

There are so many examples of far right antisemites supporting Israel for these reasons. 

[Tommy Robinson](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/nov/27/jewish-antisemitism-support-israel-gaza-zionism), a leading member of the British far right, [tried to join a march](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-67545868) in support of Israel in November 2023. He called on people to go to the Cenotaph, a war memorial in central London, to “protect” it from pro-Palestinian protesters. 
[Richard Spencer](https://www.timesofisrael.com/white-nationalist-richard-spencer-tells-israelis-that-jews-are-over-represented/), a leading member of the American far right, describes himself as a ‘white Zionist,’ saying he wants a secure homeland for ‘my people’ like the Jews have in Israel. 

Anders Breivik, who murdered 78 people in Norway in 2011, wrote in his manifesto that “Jews that support multiculturalism today are as much of a threat to Israel and Zionism (Israeli nationalism) as they are to us.”

[Viktor Orban](https://balkaninsight.com/2023/11/14/the-roots-of-orbans-strong-bond-with-israel-and-its-pm/) has shown his support for Israel, so has [the AFD in Germany](https://www.timesofisrael.com/loathed-by-jews-germanys-far-right-afd-loves-the-jewish-state/) and Marine Lepen’s Front National in France. I have already mentioned above the antisemitic conspiracy theories that Orban spread about George Soros. Alexander Gauland, leader of the AFD between 2017 and 2019, [said that](https://www.timesofisrael.com/loathed-by-jews-germanys-far-right-afd-loves-the-jewish-state/) Germany should stop feeling ""guilt"" over the Holocaust and rather start showing admiration for Wehrmacht soldiers during World War II. The founder of the Front National, Jean-Marie Le Pen, is a [Holocaust denier](https://www.dw.com/en/frances-far-right-jean-marie-le-pen-convicted-for-holocaust-denial/a-19168158), who says that the gas chambers were just “a detail of the war”. His daughter and current leader of the Front National, Marine Le Pen [denies](https://www.cbc.ca/radio/day6/episode-336-sidney-crosby-s-concussion-awesome-mix-vol-2-marine-le-pen-captain-canuck-and-more-1.4099052/how-marine-le-pen-made-a-party-co-founded-by-nazi-collaborators-mainstream-1.4099073) that France collaborated with the Nazis to commit the holocaust. 

In November 2023, Elon Musk, agreed with a post on Twitter that said Jewish people have been pushing “dialectical hatred against whites”. The same month,[ he visited Israel to show his support](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/elon-musk-israel-propaganda-that-begets-murder-must-be-stopped-2023-11-27/) and “push back against that is convincing people to engage in, you know, murder"".

US pastor John Hagee is a fervent supporter of Israel. [He was invited](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/11/17/israel-gaza-march-john-hagee/) to speak in November 2023 to an audience of thousands at the March for Israel in Washington, organised by the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, to help “condemn the rising trend of antisemitic violence”. In 2008, [he claimed](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/nationally-prominent-evan_b_249279) that Adolf Hitler had been born from a lineage of “accursed, genocidally murderous half-breed Jews” and sent by God to help the Jews reach the promised land. 

US presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr propagated the antisemitic conspiracy theory that Covid-19 was ""[targeted to spare Jewish people](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/15/us/politics/rfk-jr-remarks-covid.html)"". When he was accused of propagating antisemitism, which he denies, Kennedy chose to blast representatives like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez for insufficient support of Israel, saying that “criticism of Israel is a false narrative” and “Israel is a shining star on human rights in the Middle East”.

In the final ad of his 2016 presidential campaign, [Donald Trump](https://jewishcurrents.org/antisemitic-zionists-arent-a-contradiction-in-terms) filled the screen with images of three Jews—Soros, Janet Yellen, and Lloyd Blankfein—while the narrator warned of “global special interests” that “don’t have your good in mind.” This is the old antisemitic conspiracy theory that Jews control the financial world. At the same time, Trump has been a fervent supporter of Israel, moving the US embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. On at least three occasions, Trump has told American Jews that Israel is “your country” or Netanyahu is “your prime minister.” The implication is that the nation to which American Jews truly belong is not the United States but Israel.

&nbsp;

- **Anti zionist Jews have long made the case that Zionism is antisemitism**

The case I am making here, that Zionism is a form of antisemitism, has a long history, and this idea was shared by many Jews since the very beginning of the Zionist project. Antizionist Jews understood that Zionists and antisemites wanted the same thing, that is the expulsion of all Jews from Europe.

In 1898 Jewish journalist and playwright [Karl Kraus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Kraus_(writer) already equated Zionists with antisemites. Kraus characterized Zionism as intrinsically an antisemitic movement, and Zionists as Jewish antisemites because, like their 'Aryan' counterparts, they seek the expulsion of Jews from Europe. The risk, according to him, was that they would converge or collude with real antisemites themselves. In a review of Herzl's New Ghetto, Kraus put his accusation as follows:  

>When antisemites' chanted: ""Out with you Jews!"" (Hinaus mit euch Juden!), Zionists could be understood in effect as cheerily chiming in: ""Yes, out with us Jews!"" (Jawohl, hinaus mit uns Juden!)

Edwin Samuel Montagu was a Jewish British Liberal politician who served as Secretary of State for India between 1917 and 1922. He was the sole Jewish member of David Lloyd George’s cabinet. Montagu was strongly opposed to Zionism, which he called ""a mischievous political creed"", and opposed the Balfour Declaration of 1917, which he considered anti-Semitic. The same year, he wrote a memo titled “[On the Antisemitism of the British Government](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/montagu-memo-on-british-government-s-anti-semitism)” to express his opposition to the Balfour declaration. In this memo, he declares that the creation of a Jewish homeland in Palestine will “prove a rallying ground for Anti-Semites in every country in the world"". He further explains : 

> When the Jews are told that Palestine is their national home, every country will immediately desire to get rid of its Jewish citizens. [...] I would ask of a British Government sufficient tolerance to refuse a conclusion which makes aliens and foreigners by implication, if not at once by law, of all their Jewish fellow-citizens.

Remember the Trump quote above? That is exactly what Montagu predicted, that the creation of a Jewish ethnostate would mean that Jews would become “foreign citizens” in every country but Israel. 

&nbsp;

- **Conclusion**

Far from being a “self-determination” project for Jewish people like Zionists describe it, Zionism in itself is an antisemitic project. Instead of pushing back against antisemitism, Zionists chose to embrace it. Zionist leaders internalised antisemitic rhetoric and used it against other Jews. They share with antisemites the idea that Jews and others can’t live together and that Jews should all move to Israel. They have historically sought to ally with antisemites to further their goal, even if it meant hurting other Jews. Antisemites also love Israel back. For all these reasons, the Zionist project is antisemitic, and it has been a powerful driver of antisemitism for the last 120 years.",2024-04-18 09:20:06,"Zionism, a form of antisemitism",0.92,266,https://www.reddit.com/r/BadHasbara/comments/1c6y4qj/zionism_a_form_of_antisemitism/

I want to share my opinion on something that seems fairly obvious to be but never gets mentioned. For me Zionism was a movement to establish a Jewish state in their ancestral homeland.

This was achieved in 1948, so the zionists stop being zionists and simply became Israeli. The mission was complete. The word became redundant.

Today the word loosely means someone who thinks Israel should exist, which is bizarre because no such word exists for any other nation. There is no word for people who think Japan should exist.

So for me it’s a nonsense word that is used to cover peoples antisemitism.

serious,190zcn4,63,,r/IsraelPalestine,"This is my truth as a left-leaning American Jew, who has felt consistently overlooked, isolated, misunderstood, and un-seen by many of those closest to me ever since October 7th. This post is NOT an assessment of the ACTIONS taken by Arabs or Israelis throughout the conflict’s history. This is a purely ideological overview of how outsiders should (and should not) approach the situation.  
  
The left’s messaging about this conflict has been centered on the accusation that Israel is inherently a “colonizer state,” no different from Europe’s many imperialist endeavors throughout history. Not only is this an inaccurate notion, but it’s also hurtful to Jews everywhere because it utterly ignores our perspective at such a crucial moment of our history.   
  
Zionism is the Jewish belief that there should be a self-governed Jewish state in the region of Judaea (which had been renamed Palestine). The function of Zionism in Jewish culture has evolved dramatically over the last 200 years, alongside Jewish culture itself. The term has somewhat fallen out of constructive use since the creation of Israel in 1948, and to non-Jews today, it’s a scary-sounding phrase that’s more often associated with anti-semitic conspiracy theories than anything actually meaningful to the Jewish people. A fundamental misunderstanding of Zionism and its history is the reason why pro-Palestinian messaging in the west turns antisemitic so frequently - as is the case with the aforementioned colonizer narrative.  
  
While Zionism has existed for centuries in Jewish culture as an abstract religious ideal, modern Zionism distinguished itself primarily through two major features. Firstly, it asserted the dual status of the Jews as being, more than just a religious community, a distinct and unified ethnic group. Secondly, it involved the actual migration of Jews en masse to Palestine. The first wave of this migration occurred in the 1880s, and is called the First Aliyah. Prior to this, Zionism had mostly been a religious belief that God would one day make himself known to the world and deliver the land of Israel to the Jews. It’s this distinction between the religious and the practical that separates the modern Zionist movement from the ancient religious ideal.   
  
As a political movement, Zionism arose in the same region and time period as many other European nationalist movements, and it shared their same goals. It was the nationalist movement of the Jewish people. Through the liberal lens, history views these other nationalist movements neutrally, if not favorably, as a means through which members of a disenfranchised ethnic group could better themselves as a collective through the creation of a nation-state. The only difference between Zionism and these other national movements was that the Jews didn’t all live in a single, contiguous area from which they could fight for statehood. Nationalism can be defined as a belief in the right to self-determination among an ethnic group in a region where they constitute a majority, and the Jews were not a majority anywhere - let alone in Palestine.   
  
Through the ensuing decades, the demographics of Palestine shifted dramatically. Unprecedented antisemitism across Europe and the Muslim world led to an increase in Zionist migrations, and small pockets of Palestine becoming majority-Jewish. The anti-Jewish sentiment finally culminated in the Holocaust, which all but extinguished Jewish life from Europe. The Holocaust created millions of Jewish refugees, many of whom chose to make Aliyah to Palestine. Almost overnight in the 1940s, the small pockets of Jewish townships in Palestine had expanded to become a large swath of the territory. At that point, Zionism ceased to be different from any other nationalist movement - a concentration of Jews were all in one area, and they wanted to establish a nation-state. In 1948, when the UN recommended the creation of separate Jewish and Arab states in Palestine, it was based on borders that gave Israel a majority-Jewish population (according to the Jewish Virtual Library). After that point, to say that the Jews didn’t have the “right” to establish a nation-state somewhere within the territory of Palestine would mean applying a different set of logic to the Jews than was applied to every other ethnic group’s nationalist movement of the era. Holding Jews to that double standard is, put simply, antisemitic.   
  
That being said, the Jewish nation-state’s political and military decisions are, of course, fair game for criticism. Notice that I have not attempted to justify the Nakba. I haven’t defended Israel’s military expansion past the original borders which gave it a Jewish majority. While hugely important to the way we assess Israeli history, these events were not essential to the creation of a Jewish state, and thus irrelevant to the point I’m trying to make here. The colonizer state narrative, which alleges that the Jewish state is fundamentally illegitimate, even on the conceptual level, is more than a critique of Israeli politics. It’s a critique of the Jewish state for being Jewish.   
  
The idea that Israel should not exist as a Jewish state, which is prominent in liberal activism promoting Palestine, is the reason why Jews like myself have felt so isolated by the left recently. Nation-states have committed atrocities and initiated wars of nationalist expansion ever since the origins of modern nationalism in revolution-era France. While the international community opposed the political decisions made by these countries, there was never a serious suggestion that, for example, post-war Japan should permanently cease to be the nation-state of the Japanese people. Such a solution would have not only missed the root cause of the problems posed by imperial Japan, but instead would have created a whole new set of problems for the region to deal with. Palestinian nationalism, somewhat understandably, calls for the end of the Jewish nation-state, and rejects Zionism as the legitimate national movement of the Jewish people. Progressives, in their unconditional support of all things Palestinian, have consistently participated in this rhetoric that rejects the Jewish people as an ethnic group with the right to national self-determination. Slogans like “from the river to the sea” are so inflammatory to Jews, not only because of the immediate danger of violence that they pose to Israelis, but because they deny Jews the recognition and respect that liberalism grants to all other ethnic groups on earth - the idea that if you’re all together in one place, and you all want to self-govern, you should be able to.   
  
I fully recognize the suffering that the Palestinian people and the Arab world have faced because of Jewish nationalists. I can’t even say that I blame Palestinians for chanting anti-semitic slogans like “from the river to the sea,” because I understand their struggle. My issue is when the rest of the world, not ethnically connected to Palestine whatsoever, joins in with the same anti-Jewish messaging.  
  
My ethnic Jewish identity and my liberal politics are both core aspects of my personality, and it’s been gut wrenching to feel that the two are in conflict. I am furious with Israel for their radical politics, and I am furious with progressives for their disregard of the Jewish identity, and how Israeli statehood plays into that. While I do recognize that civilians in Gaza need help more than I do, I also see pro-Palestinian activism all over the world right now. I haven’t seen anyone make the case that I’ve laid out here. I am advocating for myself and progressive Jews like me, who have struggled to find where we fit into this toxic discourse.   
  
Do not assume that your voice can do no wrong, just because you’re using it to support an oppressed people. Do not profess to tell Jews what they should or should not believe about their own culture and history. And do NOT tell me that your views can’t be antisemitic just because there are Jews out there who agree with you. The left cannot continue its calls for the destruction of one side in a two-sided dispute. Israel needs to heed the international backlash it has received over its treatment of Palestinians, but why should the Jewish nation place any value on the opinions of those who reject its very existence?",2024-01-07 19:54:57,Zionism and Progressivism,0.75,49,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/190zcn4/zionism_and_progressivism/

,17r3dox,114,,r/unitedstatesofindia,"Indian Right Wing often makes weird alliances with the fascists of other nations. This time it is with the Zionists. As absurd it is, considering India's history of anti-colonial struggle, it is also based on misinformation. One of them is that Mahatma Gandhi was an anti-Semite. To begin with, the word anti-Semitism has a very specific meaning and has little significance outside of Europe or America.

In the case of Gandhiji, the Indian Right Wing claims that Gandhi wanted Jews to let themselves be killed by Hitler. As with any propaganda, it is completely untrue and opposite of what he said.

Gandhiji wrote about the persecution of Jews by Nazis in 1938, at the time when the leaders of Europe and America were happy to endorse and support Hitler. He expressed his sympathies with the Jewish people, and calls the persecution of Jews by the Nazis unparalleled in history. He says, “If there ever could be a justifiable war in the name of and for humanity, a war against Germany to prevent the wanton persecution of a whole race, would be completely justified.”

Gandhiji was a believer in the idea of non-violence and satyagraha. He calls upon the Jewish people to resist and fight against the oppression. He says, “If I were a Jew and were born in Germany and earned my livelihood there, I would claim Germany as my home even as the tallest gentile German might, and challenge him to shoot me or cast me in the dungeon; I would refuse to be expelled or to submit to discriminating treatment.”

> The Nazi press assaulted Gandhi savagely for these words. It threatened reprisals against India. 'I should rank myself a coward,' he replied, 'if for fear of my country or myself or Indo-German relations being harmed. I hesitated to give what I felt in the innermost recesses of my heart to be one hundred per cent sound advice.'

> Jewish Frontier, a New York magazine, ridiculed Gandhi's proposal in March 1939, and sent him a copy. He quoted at length from the attack. 'I did not entertain the hope... that the Jews would be at once converted to my view.' Gandhi replied. 'I should have been satisfied if even one Jew had been fully convinced and converted... It is highly probable that, as the (Jewish Frontier) writer says, ""A Jewish Gandhi in Germany, should one arise, could function for about five minutes and would be promptly taken to the guillotine."" But that does not disprove my case or shake my belief in the efficacy of non-violence. I can conceive the necessity of the immolation of hundreds, if not thousands, to appease the hunger of dictators.... Sufferers need not see the result during their lifetime... The method of violence gives no greater guarantee than that of non-violence...' Millions sacrifice themselves in war without any guarantee that the world will be better as a result or even that the enemy will be defeated. Yet who does not fiercely resent the suggestion that anybody should die in deliberate non-violent sacrifice?

Gandhiji likened the discrimination against Jewish people to the untouchability in India. He says that the entire world is their homeland, and refuses to endorse the colonial programme of Zionism. After the end of World War, he wrote to a Jewish journalist, wishing the Jews an era of peace.

Gandhiji was opposed to war and violence. One can say that his belief was flawed. But to claim that he was against the Jews is absurd.

Today, the Zionists' oppression and violence against Palestinian Arabs bears stark resemblance to the Nazi's treatment of Jews. More importantly, this fascist violence is backed by the powers of the West, who claim to be the torch-bearers of democracy and peace. Modi Government's refusal to vote for a humanitarian ceasefire is a shame to the entire country.

UN Secretary General António Guterres has rightly described this ongoing conflict as a “crisis of humanity,” and Gaza as a “graveyard for children.” The Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories in the West Bank and Gaza is the longest military occupation in history since The Hague Convention of 1907 and a “flagrant violation of international law”.

We must stand together in condemnation of Israeli brutality in Gaza. India, which has a history of anti-colonial struggle, and has advocated for world peace, must not only refuse to endorse Israeli war crimes, but must support the Palestinian people in their struggle.",2023-11-09 04:00:42,Why Mahatma Gandhi refused to support Zionism,0.74,171,https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedstatesofindia/comments/17r3dox/why_mahatma_gandhi_refused_to_support_zionism/

It's also at that crossroads of being ethnic group and western colonialism associated. Often the left is so anti-western imperialism, that they can't tell that the people around them (like a fair portion of the Arab world), totally is on board with the other part  too. In the end, if the effect ends up the same, idk if it really matters as a distinction. Apologies for the rant, I'm usually skeptical of Israel and the antisemite defense thrown out whenever the IDF faces criticism, but honestly seeing Ethan Klein's treatment by his fans has black pilled me into thinking this is going to only get worse.

opinion,18yxlne,130,,r/IsraelPalestine,"It seems like politicians and reddit thinks anti-Zionism is anti-Israel. It's just hard without a discussion to explain. Even when I say anti-settlement Zionist people still ask me to clarify when much of my friends have what I think is a pragmatic view.

Let's get this put of the way, no one in the world viewed colonization as bad. Conquer weaker or underdeveloped countries and profit. The end of colonization happened when the Ottoman empire was defeated. The next decade or so was getting these places to be on their own feet as much as possible. That's when Israel came into being. After the 6 day war they took Sinai, West Bank, and Golan Heights. Like WW 1 and 2. To the victor goes the spoils.

The creation of settlements in Gaza ended with them voting for Hamas and it only caused misery for both sides. Those Zionist who feel West Bank and Gaza is traditionally Jeweish land and think the Palestinians should leave. Hence the non-reentey. The Likud party that Netanyahu is part of has the party platform is ""between the sea and the Jordan. Sound familiar? 

If not then they cleared it up in 1999 by saying ""The Jewish communities in Judea, Samaria, and Gaza are the realization of Zionist values. Settlement of the land is a clear expression of the unassailable right of the Jewish people to the Land of Israel and constitutes an important asset in the defense of the vital interests of the State of Israel. The Likud will continue to strengthen and develop these communities and will prevent their uprooting."" Sounds pretty much like they don't want any Palestinians there to me.

Some of the coalition is benign. United Torah Judaism, National Unity, Noam, and Shas really doesn't care at all about West Bank. However, the Religious Zionist Party want to annex West Bank and believes Palestinians have no right to that land. They self identify as ""Jewish Supremists"" swap out Jewish with White and you can see they really don't care about Arab lives. An American author first coined this term over 20 years ago.

Otzma Yehudit are actively anti-Arab. They are publicly considered racist, Jewish Supremists, and Jewist Facists. Isreal reports on this group clearly confirms this.

I personally think that the way Netanyahu has handled this is based upon a serious section of his coalition. This is why there should be a term that can be used to clearly state that. I know other people agree with my position. For these reasons I am against this government, their handling of the retaliation, and these conflict will only continue as long as they keep turning an eye away from settlements.",2024-01-05 05:10:34,Not all anti-Zionism is anti-semitism,0.49,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/18yxlne/not_all_antizionism_is_antisemitism/

serious,17ocajv,732,,r/IsraelPalestine,"People don’t know what Zionism is and that’s really scary. And yes the meaning of this word is incredibly important

I see a lot of people claiming to be antizionist while not being antisemitic and I don’t think people understand what antizionism means at all.


The contemporary definition ever since the creation of Israel in 1948: “the preservation of the existence of the Jewish state”

That’s it, if you think Israel should be on a map and then you are a Zionist


The contemporary definition of anti-Zionism ever since the creation of Israel in 1948 is the negation of the definition of Zionism which would be “the end of the existence of the Jewish state”

If you think something should happen that dissolves the state of Israel then you are an anti-Zionist

That’s the extent of the word “Zionism” it has nothing to do with the settlements or with the executive office. And yes I’m aware that settlers are Zionists, but guess what,  the Palestinian-Israeli citizens that had to flee Hamas and were taken in and naturalized by Israel are also Zionists. The Druze, and the Christians, the secular people, and the Muslims in Israel, all are Zionists (with the obvious exceptions of radical anarchist individuals in every society)


Even the ADL knows anti-Zionism has been bastardized into a antisemitic dogwhistle and is now being used by people who simply oppose Netanyahu unaware of the word’s definition. If you’ve wondered why you’ve been called antisemitic for calling yourself antizionist, thinking it means “I oppose Israel’s military, but I still think Israel should exist” then you are in fact a Zionist, WHICH ISNT A BAD THING! You’ve just been gaslit or misinformed into thinking Zionism = Jews-when-they’re-bad


This is the most important takeaway from 
From the ADL: “Anti-Zionism is distinct from criticism of the policies or actions of the government of Israel, or critiques of specific policies of the pre-state Zionist movement, in that it attacks the foundational legitimacy of Jewish statehood.”




Zionism = \ = pro-settlements

Zionism = \ = pro-Netanyahu

Zionism = pro-Jews



Anti-Zionism = pro-Hamas

Anti-Zionism = pro-Jewish diaspora

Anti-Zionism = anti-Jew


If anyone is wondering, I am a progressive, and I’m making this post *because* I see so many misled progressives and leftists siding with Hamas, putting antizionist in their bios without understanding how horrible it is, calling for federal aid TO Hamas, tearing down hostage posters in the name of antizionism when these same people would’ve killed to punch a Nazi in the face just a couple years ago.

self,15mlid6,61,,r/Israel,"I have been a proud Zionist since my teenagerhood.  I was a member of Masada, the youth arm of the Zionist Organization of America (ZOA), and served on its national leadership for several years, as well as running their monthly magazine (Ayin L'Tzion).  I spent the summer of 1973 in Israel on the ZOA's Leadership Training Course (LTC), and spent much of the fall working in NYC during the Yom Kippur war and its aftermath.

Even back in those days, when the ZOA was far less right wing than they are today, if you'd asked a ZOA leader what their thoughts were on the issue of the Palestinians, their answer would be ""there are no Palestinians"" (or some variation thereof).

Back in those days, some 50 years ago, I disagreed strongly with that position, as I do today.  Clearly, there were Arabs living within the boundaries of Medinat Yisrael who did not want to be Israeli citizens, whose families either had lived in those areas for generations or who had  left (or been compelled to leave) and were now living in ""camps"".  These people had every right, I believed then and I believe now, to govern themselves and have their own country.

What troubles me is that every time that an Israel leader has proposed a peace plan, it has been shot down by the Palestinian ""leadership"": first Arafat and his PLO, now Hamas, Hezballah, and, to perhaps a less relevent degree, the Palestinian Authority.  But does that change the Palestinian's rights to self-government? I don't think so.

Do I still consider myself a Zionist today? Absolutely.  This is what I believe Zionism means:

1. Zionism is the right of every Jew,  of all religious persuasions (including non-observant) to come to Israel and live and be citizens. Zionism does not favor any one group, sect, community or cult above anyone else.  My Zionism does not give any religious authority the right to determine who can marry and who cannot, who can perform marriages, who can avoid service in the military,  or who can worship at the Kotel.
2.  Zionism is the absolute right of every Jew to live in Israel... but not to live anywhere and everywhere one wishes.  The Torah does not, cannot, give Jews a deed to each and every square inch of Eretz Yisrael on both sides of the Jordan River.
3. Zionism does not deny the rights of non-Jews to live in the land, and in fact requires defending that right.  My Zionism does not displace people so that Jews (any Jews) can live in their places.  My Zionism remembers that the Germans did that to us in the run-up to WWII.
4. Zionism does not favor any group of Jews above any other.

So, in light of the way Israel has developed over the last 3-4 decades and especially how things have developed since this latest government took power, am I still a Zionist?

To paraphrase Winston Churchill, my Zionism calls me to fight Netanyahu and his supporters as if there was no anti-semitism and no anti-Zionism in the world, and to fight anti-semitism and the abhorrent anti-Israel and anti- Zionist groups (both here in the U.S. and elsewhere) as if the problems with the Israel government did not exist.

opinion,1bw1qkg,91,,r/IsraelPalestine,"Before I begin, I remind everyone that across all conflicts involving Israel, on both sides, less than 100k people have died.

To glibly say ""Anti-Zionism is not Antisemitism"" or vice versa, is a betrayal of your listeners. A more nuanced, and ultimately correct take was given by a well known critic of Israel: that being the late Christopher Hitchens. To paraphrase what he we said, ""Anti-Zionism is not antisemitism, but at this point any antisemite is bound to be an antizionist"", note the important lack of a biconditional in his statement. This is the first prong of my analysis.

Second prong:

Many well understand how racism against African Americans has been transmuted into subtler more ""socially acceptable"" forms via dog whistles. Merely looking at the level of traditional hate speech, you could mistakenly get the impression that all has been mended for black Americans (this is utterly false). However, if you look more broadly, you will notice how the old brand of hatred has been cleverly converted into new guises. Apply an even more cursory analysis to the Jewish people and you can't ignore the same pattern. Now I ask, where has this hatred magically evaporated? Firstly, less of it has evaporated, in certain mainstream corners, you are regularly exposed to invective against the Jewish people. In the UK, forget about it, just read about what that disgusting racist George Galloway did to Oona King behind the scenes.

Getting back on track, if you take the current lower level of open antisemitism in the media, then add to it the egregious over reporting of Israeli issues, you derive a similar conservation principle.

Third prong: Much of the media that is dedicated to the reporting of this issue is funded by foreign governments that embrace far right traditionalist policies within their own borders. This is, of course, in stark contrast to the far-left bias of what their intellectuals write in English for western audiences. This is no accident, and it's completely cynical. What these intellectuals do, is they create an intellectual foundation for complete relativism, that makes us in the west feel like the bad guys. And of course, we should feel so guilty that we stop and allow a new order to take power. That order consisting of China, Russia, Pakistan, and all of these other places. The genocide narrative in Israel, only furthers the self humiliation of the western leftist, to the point that he no longer feels justified even, in defending himself.

Once the west is ideologically crippled by this guilt, it will be washed away by the new nationalists who will promptly drop their progressive disguises. See yourself how quickly the money funding anti Isreli leftists can be traced back to far right religious sources.

You have to be careful dealing with cults because honestly, facts and logic don’t mean a damn thing.  Zionists live in a completely different version of reality than we do and thats why civil discussion is nearly impossible.

There are very delicate ways to approach and deprogram people if you have a close friend or loved one who is a Zionist.  If you confront their beliefs directly the “backfire effect” will take place and they’ll further entrench and retreat into what they already know.  

Approach it using “gentle parenting” or the styles amazing teachers know.  Don’t be condescending, meet them where they are and slowly introduce your perspective. I reccomend reading through r/exmormon or r/exjw for more details.

The TLDR is that the greatest proponents of Zionism both in Israel and in the West were historically from the left, particularly the far left. Israel was conceived as a leftist state and in many ways followed that template for the first few decades of independence. 

Obviously this is no longer the case and I am sure the argument is due to the Palestinian issue. The thing is, as everybody knows, conflict between Jews and Arabs in the land of Israel has more or less always been existed. 

My question then is: if the Left is genuinely motivated by concern for the treatment of Palestinians then why was this not an overriding concern from the beginning?

discussion,17tq45h,205,,r/IsraelPalestine,"I've seen many people here and on other places refer to Zionists, or the zionist ideology or the term ""pro-zionist"" when referring to Israeli or Israel's actions. It's usually people that are against Israel's stance, some are pro-palestinian and some are just anti-Israeli.

To me it feels a bit weird. I mean - the Zionist movement was a movement aimed at creating a jewish nation on the land that's now Israel. It did it's goal. this nation exists. Of course that there are some branches for the zionist movement that have the goal of expanding Israel to the entire historic Israel - but these were a minority of the zionist movement and this is a small minority opinion in Israel today as well.

Now it's also true that you can find Israeli that are somewhat with the opinion that removing Israel is good, but these are again - a very small minority that I don't think most of the people that call Israeli zionists are aware of them and it feels kind of weird to change the words just because of this tiny minority.

To me, it feels a bit like dehumanization or delegitimization (like all of the other bad ist words). I am Israeli and yes, I'm a zionist in the sense that I think my country should exist - but I think most people would identify with wanting their country to exist. Especially with the implications of removing it. I think I'd feel this way regardless of my religion and indeed most Israeli of all religions support Israel's right to exist - and therefore zionists. So I really don't know if this word has too much meaning these days unless you think Israel shouldn't exist.

So why use the word zionist instead of saying Israeli or pro-Israeli?  


Edit - I think I wasn't clear enough in the post. I know that there are people outside of Israel that define themselvs as Zionists, and some, beilive that modern zionism is some kind of improvement of Israel (very vauge without mentioning the specific way). I think some people, know that zionism is the existance/improvement of a jewish state and support it and it makes sense for them to use it. I think probably there are people who use this term as being pro-Israel which is kind of what's the post is about.

This is a false association. There are many Jews, including Ilan Pape, Noam Chomsky, Katie Halper, Norm Finkelstein, and Bernie Sanders himself, who speak out against the ongoing zionist project to eliminate the Palestinian people.

Zionism, as the mainstream defines it, is the idea of national self-determination for the Jews. The argument goes that the denial of self-determination to the Jews — from the same people who believe in the self-determination of the Palestinians, the Yemenis, or the Irish — is arbitrary. “These groups deserve self-determination, but *these* groups do not.”


In response to this, many opponents of Zionism will point to the Amazigh, the Assyrians, and, well, the Kurds, as groups that may like self-determination but do not have it. They use it as a, “*see*, you’re not the *only* ones for whom self-determination doesn’t make sense.”


However, this just all seems so…arbitrary. The argument that “well, that’s how history has played out, so…” for why some groups “deserve” self-determination and others do not. 


I know that there have been so many questions here of “do you support Israel,” and I am also aware that Kurdistan is *very* different from Zionism. That’s not what I’ll ask.

We would like to remind everyone that this is r/Jewish. We are primarily a sub for discussions about the Jewish people, Judaism, and a support sub for all Jewish people.

When certain things are affecting Jews everywhere -- swastikas on subways, protests blocking streets, hate crimes -- yes, we can talk about it here. When it's ""The UN has said ___ about Netanyahu."" that goes onto an Israel related subreddit. Also think of the extent of the actual offense. A business that you don't go to having a ""Free Palestine"" sign in the window is not the same as someone smashing windows on a Jewish-owned store and spray painting it with slurs. Posts about feeling alone, friends and family abandoning you, and things of that nature are allowed. We are here for support.

This subreddit is dedicated to remaining a welcoming place for ALL Jews. And while we have always had political debates here from time to time, it's time to refocus our attention on support, humor, food, and -- did you realize Pesach is so very soon? Stock up on matzo, people!

Because the Anti-Zionist position is simply logically unreasonable and it becomes impossible to support it without starting to distort reality or holding Israel to absurd standards well above any other country in the world while expecting absolutely nothing from the Palestinian side. 

I write this as a British person though I think the themes are somewhat similar across the 'west'. The political left has an interest in social justice but they don't realise that this is something that Anti-Zionists know and use to manipulate them. They end up being what might elsewhere be described as 'flying monkeys'. I suppose 'useful idiots' is another way of putting it. I see people slowly sinking down a rabbit hole where they start to say more and more concerning things that you wouldn't say about another group.

It doesn't take that long before someone is saying things that are classic antisemitism but replacing the word 'Jew' with 'Zionist' is somehow enough to make it righteous. I am not sure what to do about this as the people who are doing it seem to be completely unaware. Regardless of someone's intent I think it's quite antisemitic to be calling for the destruction of the only Jewish state on the planet based on flawed reasoning. 

So I ask the question because it's often stated that Jews and Zionism are not the same thing and therefore it is not antisemitic to be Anti-Zionist. The first point is true although I wonder about the second.

If you're against the general concept of Jews achieving and maintaining statehood, you're by proxy against Jewish people living in peace and security, which means you have just defaulted to anti-semitism, or you are at the very least encouraging others to be anti-semitic, including those who already are, whether or not you are able or willing to understand and acknowledge that fact.

Nevermind that ""anti-zionism"" is a perfect dog whistle for Jew hatred, although of course proponents will (and do!) vehemently challenge that notion.

But why is it only Israel that anti-zionists have such contempt for but no other religious based, for example Muslim, state in existence, of which there are many?

There is only one Jewish state on Earth and people are advocating abolishing it while pretending it has nothing to do with Jews.

Why isn't it possible for ""anti-zionists"" to criticize Israel's government without calling for its utter dissolution?

For example, America is a Christian nation and there are a plethora of valid criticisms of America and American history and American policies, of which I have many, but that doesn't mean I require America to cease to exist in order to feel better about it.

This led many Jews to be emotional about Zionism. We’ve always prayed “We are in the West, but our hearts are in the East” and “Next year in Jerusalem”, to beg G-D for the arrival of Messiah. Important to say, almos any rabbi of the 19th century opposed Zionism: Judaism prescribes that only the Messiah can end this exile, and that the return to Zion will not be “like climbing a wall of glass” (As the Talmud says, so it won’t be something difficult but the whole world will accept it).",2023-11-18 18:15:57,Why so many jews fell for Zionism.,0.74,74,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/17yb3c5/why_so_many_jews_fell_for_zionism/

> [So, I have Tenure now. Let's see how useful it is.
In a family discussion, someone raised an essential question about recent congressional testimony from Harvard, MIT, and Penn representatives, asking, ""Isn't free speech about protecting even the speech we dislike?"" This is true; the issue here is the selective application of free speech by universities, which I'd like to highlight with a couple of examples of the inconsistent application at the core of the debate:](https://x.com/Prof__Welch/status/1732435045619478804?s=20)

> First, in 2017, Harvard University revoked admission offers to at least ten students due to racest comments made in private chats with each other. This compares to public antisemitic hateful comments in 2023 by current students. The Constitution limits how much government can suppress speech, but not a private university (i.e., Harvard can do what they want). Harvard chose to punish students for private racist comments but not public comments calling for the death of Jews. This is an obvious selective application of free speech, and it is obvious.

> Second, the universities have been overwhelmed with obsessive Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) efforts. These efforts force people to accept one perspective on multiple topics (e.g., you can be any gender you want) without any allowance for alternative opinions (e.g., the two-gender perspective that has existed for thousands of years) to protect people. This is fine, but they do not show the same level of scrutiny when it comes to public comments calling for harm to a particular group, like Jews. This selective application of DEI and free speech standards raises concerns about promoting bigotry. The failure to see this disqualifies anyone from one of these leadership positions. 

> Three, a Hamline University lecturer showed a painting of the prophet Muhammad and was fired. This professor offered people by showing a painting, and the result was termination. Yet, make antisemitic statements, and administrations take a ""two sides to every story"" response.

> Fourth, a USC professor doesn't say a racist word but says a word that sounds like the n-word in Chinese (there is a Chinese word that sounds like the n-word but is entirely unrelated). So this is a case where the speech was not even offendable as it was not even on topic, yet the professor was put on leave and replaced. 

> Fifth, a Yale couple (two professors) were run out of the school because they advocated FOR free speech and dialog. Because they advocated for free speech and dialog and not ""safe spaces"", they were run off of campus at Yale. Yet schools used free speech as a shield for allowing antisemitic dialog. The problem is the selective outrage 

> I used to be embarrassed to say I went to Harvard--I didn't want people to think I was an arrogant D-bag. Thanks to the President of Harvard's testimony, that's changed. I'm now embarrassed because I don't want them to think I'm a bigoted d-bag.

All in all I think this is worthwhile for other students to see and discuss. Feel free to talk about any of the other issues happening around campus now too.

I'm a random white american, so I got no real background or familial involvement here.

With that out of the way, my question:

I've heard a number of different arguments from pro and anti zionist folks.

I'll also preface this with my (admittedly basic) understanding of zionism:
Basically, if you look at the history of jewish people, they kept getting killed or pogromed. wherever they go. Everyone always seems to scapegoat and murder them. And not wanting to get murdered is a fairly sympathetic goal. The reason they could always be scapegoated is because they were always a minority. So if they were the majority, then they would be able go ensure no anti-semitic violence would be done (on a large scale at least). Hence the idea for a jewish state. There were several initial locations discussed, including Uganda and Argentina, but the Levant was the ultimate choice.

Pro:

-Jews are indigenous to Israel. Many were expelled by imperial powers and forced abroad. Some stayed in the region continuously for hundreds of years. There are many artifacts and archeological sites that show jewish habitation for centuries back. Therefore Israel represents DECOLONIZATION rather than colonization

-Many current Israelis aren't even from Europe, they're from surrounding African and Asian countries after major expulsions due to anti-semitic violence. Not only that but many of the European settlers were also fleeing anti-semitic violence in Europe. Can a refugee really count as a settler colonialist?

-The initial settlements were bought legally and therefore ought to belong to the purchasers.

-Palestinian nationalism emerged in the 60s and has no real roots before the establishment of Israel. Before that they were just thought of as Arab and wanted to be a part of a larger Arab state

Anti:

-It's true there's been a continuous jewish presence in Palestine. However, these jews spoke completely different languages then the ones who started showing up in the early 20th century. They were also a minority of the population. There was very little overlap between the jews that started arriving and those that were already there. In fact the PLO classified the jews that were already there as part of the Palestinian national identity (according to wikipedia anyways). If anyone could claim indigenity it would be these jewish folks and the Palestinain population they were a part of, rather than the folks who started showing up in the early 20th century.

-The 1948 plan was vastly disproportionate to the relative populations and quality of land. Furthermore in the 1948 war, operation dalet led to the forced removal of many palestians from their homes as was explicitly spelled out. Plus there were a variety or atrocities committed in an attempt to force Palestinians out.

-Ben Gurion, Herzl amd many other early Zionists explicitly used the terms ""colonial"" and ""colonists"" and how the ""arab population must be forced out"". In fact, herzl wrote to Cecil Rhodes seeking his advice about colonization for this purpose.

-It is ridiculous to claim that a jewish person in New York has a greater claim of indigenity to land thousands of miles away than someone whose family and them have lived on it for generations. Yes, Palestinian jews may claim indigenity but not Jewish folks from New York or Chicago or LA.

-The initial zionist plans involved discussions of colonization of Argentina and Uganda. Lands that have literally 0 connection to jewish history. If zionism isn't settler colonial in nature why were Uganda and Argentina discussed in the first place? Why does moving the location change the fundamental nature of the project?

-there is evidence of palestinain self identity back in the 1830s, but it really got going post Sykes-Picot.


Mixed:

-Land claims are complex. While it is true Arabs arrived in the region later, families have lived there for generations by this point. Hundred and hundreds of years. If jewish folks in london have a claim to it, surely folks whose families have been there for generations do as well. 



Tbh I am not even sure how useful this discussion is to have as I don't think that either the Israeli or palestinain population is gonna up and leave anytime soon. Any peace deal is gonna have to figure out how to share land. I'm not sure how or the right answer here but I don't believe they'll be some Maas exodus of one population.

But like i said, tryna learn.


EDIT:

After discussing here I've come around to the view it is settler colonialist.

While it is true that jewish folks originally come from the Levant, if diaspora jewish folks have a land claim because their ancestors lived there, then surely so do palestians who have also been living there for generations. 

The issue is the establishment of an EXCLUSIVELY jewish state, which ignores the valid land claims of palestians.

To enforce this denial of land claims, the Israeli government used extensive violence to force Palestinians out of their homes and massacred a lot of them. 

Had there been an agreement to share land instead of the prioritization of one group over the other then I doubt there'd be a huge issue.

The problem is attempts to expel people. That's not to like demonize jewish migrants or refugees of anti-semitic violence, rather its about recognizing the validity of the palestinain cause/land claims.",2023-10-12 16:42:40,Can Zionism be classified as a form of settler colonialism?

OPdelta,17f6fkz,1115,,r/changemyview,"There's quite a bit of posts about the conflict but if you're here then you're interested!

Quick note: I am not saying we should not support PalestiNIANS (the people), what they're going through is a horrendous nightmare

Anyway, I want to quickly say what I think I know so that if I'm mistaken it can be pointed out:

- Israel took over most of the surrounding land including what some argue rightfully belong to Palestine, and that this was a long time ago
- This conflict has lasted years and several battles, with the current one being yet another fight for Palestine to take their land back
- However, Israel has tried around 5 times to come to a peaceful agreement (involving the UN at some point) about these lands which have been rejected by Palestine every time
- Lastly, the initiators of today's conflict are literal terrorists

Ok and this is why I hold my view:

- First of all, Palestine begun this conflict (again). Why is anyone supporting the perpetrator of a war that has already caused so much destruction and murder of innocent people
- Also, these were TERRORISTS!!! There's a group in my home country that are similar to Hamas, and if they ever pulled something like this I would never support my country... yet so many support this.
- Israel has had this land for a decently long time, why is Palestine still fighting for it? They're clearly militarily inferior and can't protect it, they should be taking a peace treaty at all costs
- I understand the implications of the land being controlled by Israel (Economic troubles and such) but does this really justify the killing of thousands of innocent people?
- Lastly, it seems Israel is launching a counterattack that to me seems to be fair, they keep getting attacked for the same thing so it's time to shut off Hamas for good. Hamas uses civilians to protect itself while Israel seems to just want to protect its people whatever the cost.

I understand that because of the recent border blockage many Palestenians do not have access to food which is very unjust and horrible to the innocent people, but this has been a common tactic to pressure governments to stop attacks and converse diplomatically or surrender.

That is all, I'm very open to having my view changed on this matter if I'm persuaded. And just in case this is brought up; I am not from either of these countries or their surrounding areas, and I'm also not originally from any of the countries are actively supporting either side, I hold this view purely out of the information I have provided.",2023-10-24 07:38:45,CMV: No one should support Palestine,0.78,465,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17f6fkz/cmv_no_one_should_support_palestine/
,18gut09,194,,r/Jewish,"They think it's like ""Free Tibet"" or something.

It's the cause of the moment for a lot of people on the left - people who have no understanding of the history of the region or what they're supporting.

All they see is an oppressed population that's being bombed.  That's literally all they know.  Many of them believe those stupid maps they see on social media that make it look - without any context - like Israel was created and then started slowly encroaching on Palestinian land for no reason.

They haven't even begun to ask themselves what kind of country would be created if ""Palestine"" were ""free"", or what that would mean for their neighbors (especially Israel but not just Israel - there's a reason Egypt wants absolutely nothing to do with Gaza or Hamas).

My point is that people who write or say ""free palestine"" are often not *trying* to be antisemitic.  They (in my experience) don't even understand why jews would be upset by this.

It makes me despondent when I see so many people on this sub replying ""well just ghost them, they're not your friends.""  I really think that's not helpful.  I understand that dialogue in these cases often seems useless, but it's not.

For example: in marketing, they say it takes seven times of hearing a brand name before you start to recognize it and build an idea about it.

So you, in your one conversation with that one friend, might not change their mind.  But if they keep having the same conversation that tells them - with empathy - that they are being hurtful to jewish people and explains a little of the context and history, then they will start to see some of the reason and temper their opinions.

If you just cut people off, the message is clear: they (so they think) want freedom for oppressed people, and that made you go no contact.  It's worse than them learning nothing, you have reinforced their poor opinion.  It's our *duty and responsibility* to set the record straight.

OPdelta,17jns4u,3054,,r/changemyview,"Pro-Palestine efforts are shooting themselves in the foot by not condemning Hamas. It's making the movement come off as ideological instead of rational as well as ambivalent to human suffering, not unlike the ways in which Israel has been ideological and ambivalent to the suffering of Palestinians. I think, to most people, the very true fact that Israel's treatment of Palestine *explains* the situation is simply not enough to *justify* the deaths of civilians, and that disconnect is hurting the reputation of the free Palestine movement. Hamas has damaged the reputation of Palestine by targeting civilians, and supporters of a free Palestine would rally far more support if they'd communicate, directly and without concession, the fact that the actions of Hamas were morally reprehensible, without concluding that they were ""necessary"" or, in so many words, that ""Israel had it coming."" Unless the majority of Pro-Palestine individuals *are* indeed Pro-Hamas (which I don't want to just assume flippantly because I have no way of knowing whether or not that's true) I don't understand why more people don't condemn Hamas explicitly instead of responding to the attack on Gaza with Pro-Palestine sentiments.

,17geadx,989,,r/biglaw,"I’m using reddit because at least my name isn’t on here, but I’m genuinely scared. I’m  Palestinian, and while I don’t have anyone in my family Gaza (they’re all in the West Bank where they’re at least alive and in lockdown but still horrified), I have so many friends and their families that are. I have a friend who lost 21 family members and another who’s parents and her are in a hospital and I haven’t been able to reach her in a week and just hoping she’s alive.

I want to be able to advocate for a ceasefire. Advocate for humanitarian aid to enter Gaza. So many Palestinians are just normal people who don’t deserve to be bombed. The collective punishment is inhumane, it’s literally a genocide. Hamas taking hostages and killing Israelis is not okay. Antisemitism is unacceptable. I don’t want any more people to die. I want this to stop. I haven’t been able to sleep in two weeks. They killed 700 Palestinians last night alone in Gaza and 305 were children. I’ve seen images that will haunt me for the rest of my life. 

Honestly, even this Reddit terrifies me. The legal field refuses to condemn Israel but expects everyone to condemn Hamas, but Israel’s bloodshed in this short term incident is 5x that of Hamas’. 1.4 million Palestinians have become homeless because Israel has indiscriminately bombed all their homes. Palestinians are defenseless, and the world hates them and wishes them gone. Two wrongs don’t make a right. The partners and the emails I get never acknowledge Palestinians. It makes me wish I didn’t exist to witness these horrors where no one does anything or even worse cheer for the death of my people. There is no justification. It hurts so much and I can never say that out loud at work or I’ll get called a terrorist/antisemite, but really I just want people to stop dying.",2023-10-25 21:30:47,Terrified to speak out about Israel/Palestine,0.79,2364,https://www.reddit.com/r/biglaw/comments/17geadx/terrified_to_speak_out_about_israelpalestine/

university-posts,1b1ohka,485,,r/berkeley,"For context, my mom’s side of the family is part Palestinian and part Libyan.

I had a late study sesh on campus a few days ago that lasted into around 7ish. I started noticing people shoving, some guy spitting, and another girl just shouting at some dude. I come to find out it’s because of a Jewish speaker and people were upset that he was there I guess (from what a UCPD man said).

It is pretty unfortunate now how close-minded some individuals are that they intimidate/protest open discussion. It feels like a step backward, especially at a school known for championing free speech. Instead of leveraging our diverse backgrounds to enrich conversations, it seems like we’re drawing lines that are harder to cross. The whole point of ‘free speech’ is to explore different perspectives, not just echo our own in louder volumes. I have a lot of Jewish friends and yes we disagree on a plethora of topics and issues but I love the fact that those same friends can change my perspective on my viewpoints and vice versa.

 Obviously thousands of innocent people dying at the hands of one government is horrible and wrong on all levels, I don’t think any sane human would disagree with that. The point I am making is that, how as a society can we move forward by suppressing the voice of your “opposition”? 

That will only end in chaos. 

I hope that one day again, we can all talk to each other without the oppression of speech just because you don’t like what the guy with the microphone had to say.

,176y1pk,999,,r/Britain,"If you don't know the whole truth, here's a historical summary to clarify some points:

‎The war that has been going on between Israel and Palestine is not a war between two countries, therefore, the attack by the Palestinian resistance is not a declaration of war but rather a reaction to the violations that have been happening for more than 70 years against the Palestinian people.

‎For more than a century, the Palestinian territories belonged to the Ottoman Empire. During the First World War, as the Ottomon Empire weakened, the United Kingdom occupied Palestine.

‎In 1917, the British Foreign Secretary, in a letter to Lionel Rothschild, declared his full support for the formation of a Jewish state in the Palestinian territories. We call it “a promise from someone who has nothing to someone who doesn't deserve it”.

‎At the beginning of the implementation of this fateful promise, the number of Jews in Palestine was 7%. After the immigration of European Jews to the British protectorate, the total Jewish population in Palestine grew to 28%.

‎After World War II, the UN issued a resolution for the partition of Palestine between Arabs and Jews in 1947.

‎On May 14, 1948, Israeli leaders met at the Tel Aviv museum and announced the end of the British occupation of Palestine and the establishment of the state of Israel, recognized by the Soviet Union and the United States.

‎The 1948 war:
‎Many Arab countries rejected the unjust occupation of Palestine and its division by the United States. After successive wars with US support, Israel occupied larger areas than those initially envisaged by the United States.

‎Many Palestinian organizations, armed and unarmed, fought together for the liberation of their state, which was unjustly divided and occupied.

‎Violations against Palestinians are committed daily and systematically. There are more than 100 thousand registered martyrs, twice that number has not been counted and there are more than a million dead.

‎Violations are carried out in various aspects of life, including education, health, supplies that are constantly cut off, violations of religious sanctities and provocations on Palestinian commemorative dates and holidays.

‎Israel does not intend to give the Palestinians peace, and does not want a Palestinian state to be established near “its” lands. The Palestinian area is shrinking daily while territories controlled by Israel are expanding.

‎Google the neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrahm and you will see Palestinian violations and Israeli occupations. The Palestinian reaction is just a reaction to daily violations, which are not reported as much as they should be.

This is terrorism, plain and simple. In a couple instances it was Israeli soldiers which is at least not innocent civilians but the way they treated their bodies and paraded them and stomped on them is disgusting. I can now see why Israel needs to defend itself and it's people. I don't think they should be bombing equally innocent people on the Palestine side but I can see why they should defend themselves because the things I saw today we're revolting and horrific. I still think both sides should still strive to find peace but I am not sure if this is even possible after today's acts. Hamas likely will need to be eradicated and eliminated, vile people.

bzr,1bcs0jx,593,,r/TrueUnpopularOpinion,"1. Don't get me wrong. I support the idea that Palestinians deserve freedom in the land that they are living at. There are almost 10 million Israeli citizens, where 7.5 millions of them are Jews, who enjoy high standard of living (Israel HDI is 0.919 similar to USA). They can travel and live in any parts of Israeli controlled territories (including West Bank). Meanwhile the 2.5 millions Palestinians in the West Bank don't have such privileges. They live in occupied territories under Israeli military control, often time get kicked out of their houses out of the blue and harassed by settlers and soldiers. They cannot build houses or start new businesses outside their current cities, they have to get permits to work inside Israel or to travel abroad, and their borders are controlled by Israel. Basically, they live in an open air prisons. I believe Israel should give Palestinians some sort of accommodation
2. But the biggest problem that I have is a lot of pro-Palestine activists are extremely anti-semitic, anti-Israel and rude. They often post Palestinian flag emojis and yelling ""free Palestine"" on any post that vaguely related to Israel. Many videos or posts that show Jewish people wearing yamaka always have bunch of comments like ""Free Palestine"", although those people probably don't care about the war. Any posts that shown Israeli flag (like top countries with unicorn startups) would also got flooded with ""Israel doesn't exist"" or ""Free Palestine from occupiers"", although the post has nothing against Palestine and its people.
3. Pro-Palestine activists also need learn the difference between ""their problems"" and ""other's problems"". Some of them got mad at me for going to McDonald's or Starbucks. Like I get that you are part of the boycott movement, but just because you have a problem with a company, doesn't mean I have to do the same. Forcing people support your movement make your movement look ugly.
4.   
At my university, we have confession pages where students share stories about crushes, academic struggles, friendships, and more. After the war started, some activists are like ""Many North American kids are too pre-occupied with their lameass love stories, superficial problems, while thousands of Gazans kids are starving. I find that insensitive and ignorant"". Like seriously? Just because some people over there have problem, now North Americans are forced to worry about Palestinians and not allowed to live their life?

I'm hosting a debate on Israel-Palestine in \~2 weeks, in-person. Published about a week after that (since I'm traveling). The people involved are:

**Palestine:**  
Norm Finkelstein, Mouin Rabbani

**Israel**:  
Benny Morris, Destiny

I will also likely do a solo conversation with Norm and Benny individually next day as a follow-up.

If you have questions and topics you'd like to see us cover please let me know. Super-specific is great. We want to cover a lot of ground (history, current events, geopolitics, leaders, religion, corruption, propaganda, philosophy, etc), and go for many hours. My hope is to make it a conversation not a strict debate.

I wanted to mention some debate options that are on the table. I spoke with the following people:

* Destiny
* Norman Finkelstein
* Benny Morris

**Goal:** All of them are in. However, I'm torn. First, my goal is for the debate/conversation to be similar to Shapiro/Destiny in being free-flowing, fair, good-faith, respectful, and productive.

Destiny is happy with participating or not. He also told me that he prefers 2v2 because 1v1 with Norm might not be the style of conversation I'm looking for. As you may already know, Norm also doesn't want 1v1 with Destiny. I can convince him, but I feel like in a 1v1 setting he will talk down to Destiny forcing Destiny to respond which will create a disrespectful environment where idea exploration can't happen. I think getting Benny Morris in the room will fix that, but in my mind, then why not just have 2 old-school historians Norm vs Benny do the debate. 1v1 debate is much easier to manage, and is much more conducive to a conversational-style.

I ask for your help in making the case for & against Destiny's participation this round of the debate. If he participates, how will he add to the conversation. For example, here is Norm & Benny in 2010:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ag7bSPFhb1Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ag7bSPFhb1Q)

**Options**:

1. **2v2 debate:** Destiny & Benny Morris vs Norm Finkelstein & Mouin Rabbani
2. **1v1 debate:** Benny Morris vs Norm Finkelstein
3. **Solo episodes:** Benny Morris and Norm Finkelstein separately, and see about debate later

I ask the following in the replies you leave on this post:

1. Please do not troll or make fun of any of the people I mentioned. I'm seriously trying to think through what would be the best conversation (quality not views, etc). You CAN however make fun of me, of course.
2. Try not to think what is best for Destiny's career in the short-term. He'll be great either way. There are many other huge debates on the horizon including on the topic of Israel-Palestine, where it will be more good faith and longer, and there will be more time for Destiny to speak. For example, I can possibly arrange Destiny v Hasan, Destiny v Alex Jones, Destiny v Nick Fuentes, Destiny v Vaush, etc.

I'm also considering just doing solo episodes with Norm Finkelstein and Benny Morris separately. Anyway, advice and wisdom on this is appreciated.

**As an additional consideration,** I should mention that it will take a lot of work (financial, time, effort, prep, etc) to get all those folks in the same room.

Thank you for your advice. Love you you all ❤

**EDIT:** Your comments are amazing and extremely helpful. Thank you 🙏 Also, thanks to the comments, I realized that Destiny and Benny have already spoken, and they seem to have good chemistry, so this is a big plus: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYUkb49BdmQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYUkb49BdmQ) I'll watch this carefully and continue thinking.

I’m a 20 year old, Palestinian-Canadian. I’m having a go at this as I saw a previous poster give this a shot. He answered many questions well but I see a lot of questions have gone unanswered.

Some background: I was born in Palestine. I came to Canada at a year and a half but visit very often (my last visit was June-September). I can track my family lineage 7 generations back and have a very, very large family (100+ relatives) living in West Bank with whom I’m regularly in touch. My family is one of 4 founding families in our city. 

I’ve been to many prominent places such as Jerusalem, Bethlehem, Nablus, Ramallah, Jericho and Tel Aviv (on a permit a near decade before). My family has had occasional encounters with settlers and the IDF spanning back decades. I have family that work in Israel. Some who speak Hebrew. Some who learned Hebrew in prison. I say all this purely to widen the scope of questioning and for no alternate reason. My goal here is to be as subjective as I can, given my identity, to inform you what you’d like to know.

Canada has exposed me to a cultural melting pot (much like our Holy Land) and has allowed me to meet a handful of Israelis, though many I didn’t originally know were Israeli. Funny enough, I played chess with one girl in the after-camp program at the YMCA everyday for a full summer before learning she was Israeli on the last day. I didn’t say I was Palestinian then.

To reiterate, I’m here to open a dialogue (primarily with those residing or have close family in Israel) to offer insight from a different perspective in hopes of attempting to give everyone a bird’s eye view of the ongoing situation. Please keep things respectable and I will try answer questions to the best of my abilities. 

*Edit*

I encourage any open-minded individual who can put aside personal biases and is Israeli (preferably one who’s spent time in Israel) to try an AMA on the Palestinian subreddit. It can seem intimidating, but if even one person absorbs what you’ve given freely, then you’ve fostered something that didn’t previously exist. Just as I intend to do. Well worth it.

The German state is doing its best to suppress any pro-Palestinian voices to make it look like the population is standing behind its genocidal antics. While I‘m sure part of the German population is in support of the war, I personally think a large majority simply don’t care or don’t want to speak up (in classic German bystander tradition). But especially among the younger generation there are many who do care and I felt the need to show you that hope isn’t lost for all of us. Free Palestine 🇵🇸 from Germany!

I feel as though this is being placed in the antisemitism category but is what I’m saying in this comment actually antisemetic? I was merely arguing the origins of Hamas stem deeper into a long seeded conflict that has seen palestinians on the losing side 9 times out of 10.   I’m not anti Israel, I’m pro two state solution and have been long before oct 7th. I was merely pointing out the pretty obvious fact that Hamas is a product of 70+ years of denying Palestinian personhood in the pursuit of establishing Israeli personhood. Is it really that controversial to state something that seems so obvious? I’ve grown up around Jewish people ny entire life, some of my dearest friends are Jewish and I talk to them about this stuff too. I just feel like the world is starting to operate on varying fact sets, how can there be room for conversation if we aren’t even starting with same sets of facts?

,1bemf7p,2140,,r/changemyview,"**Edit: after a few days of comments, here is where I currently stand:**

90% have really not tried to answer my question at all, instead just justifying the violence, saying “what do you expect them to do?”, which *I have EXPLICITLY mentioned is NOT the topic in question, as it’s subjective and not really liable to change through a Reddit post; and/or calling me out using deflections, whataboutisms, attacks ad-hominem, strawmen, red herrings and basically all logical fallacies you’ve got in the toolbox. Other comments have said it’s not about gaining anything, but about dying for the sake of defying Israel, which actually strongly supports my argument and suggests that these commenters do NOT want peace and really don’t care about Palestinians, only about virtue-signaling that they’re anti-colonialism. Another common argument which, to be frank, I find disgusting is the idea that international Western support rests on Palestinian violence against Israelis. This is plain wrong if you only look at it at face value, since only sickos cheer on blind indiscriminate violence targeted deliberately at civilians, either Israelis or Palestinians, regardless of which side you take in the conflict. The only really plausible reasoning I found is that Palestinian violence elicits a strong retaliation from the IDF, creating much pain and suffering for innocent Palestinians, which is used to garner international sympathy. This basically justifies the cynical use of Palestinians by their own leadership, exacerbating their situation in order to gain international points which translates to funds going to Qatar. This isn’t doing the Palestinians any favor and cynically sacrifices Palestinian lives for international sympathy. This, it actually reinforces the Israeli-narrative that Hamas and co endorse attacks by the IDF on innocents for donations. You guys should *really* think about what you’re saying. 

**The only actual convincing argument was as follows:**

1. **OSLO ACCORDS**: came about after the 1st intifada. What birthed the accords is very complex, and can be attributed to very high counts of lone-wolf type terrorism with many Israeli casualties and likewise a strong retaliation from the IDF, along with internal politics in Israel and the PLO together with Norway, US and other countries in the west that pushed the two belligerents into signing the Camp David Accord in 2000. The intifada has definitely *not* helped the Palestinians’ situation overall: up until then they had free passage throughout Israel, no borders/walls/checkpoints, were better off economically and had way less violent tackles with the IDF. The Oslo accords did, on the other hand, afforded the Palestinians the first ever official recognition by Israel, their own semi-autonomous zone, which is far from perfect but much closer to self-determination than before. At least until Arafat died and Abu-Mazen was just too incompetent and corrupt to really govern his territory properly. Anyway, I need to either do more research or discuss this with ya’ll. 

Timeframe: pre-48 escalation up to present day.

*Every* violent act of resistance or terrorism has carried negative long-teen consequences to Palestinians’ quality of life, without actually managing to obtain anything other than international sympathy. The negative consequences include military retaliation, harsher restrictions, further radicalization of  Israelis which obviously affects the Palestinians and only aids in perpetuating the cycle of violence.

Now, I’m not saying all of Israel’s policies are a consequence of Palestinian terrorism, but, depending on your outlook, have either elicited or at the very least provided a neat excuse for a response. Notice how most Israeli restrictions just chronologically follow Palestinian violence. For example, the wall dividing the WB from Israel came about after the intifada. The siege of Gaza came after the kidnapping of Gilad Shalit. The 2014 war came after the kidnapping and murdering of 3 teens by Hamas. All these acts have *MASSIVE* repercussions for the average Palestinian. Not to mention smaller-scale attacks with smaller-scale responses.

I’m asking Reddit to provide me with examples for times when Palestinian led violence against Israelis has managed to secure any kind of actual, practical advantage for the Palestinian civilians. Edit: Note I’m **not discussing whether it’s justified or not, or whether Palestinians have a RIGHT to defend themself, just where or not it’s effective**.

Disclaimer: I’m an Israeli citizen, though a very left-wing leaning one (do with it as you will). I *really am looking for a real discussion*, not dishing out “Hasbara”. Additionally, I despise being identified as a Zionist although the hardline propalis would consider me as such, and I admittedly have quite a pro-Israeli stance though it’s way softer than expected as I really *do* deeply care about the well-being of Palestinians. Anyway, I’m really knowledgeable about the history of the region so please no making stuff up.

I introduced myself, and he said ""a-salaam alechem! My name is ____, which mosque do you pray in? I didn't know there was one here!"" I smiled, and said ""alechem shalom ____"" And he just kinda tilted his head like, ""huh??"" And I apologized for the confusion, because I do wear a fairly large, knit black kippah and my beard is fairly long. I just like the larger kippot because smaller ones feel like they're going to fall off. He was so intrigued, like, ""wow I seriously thought you were an Arab Muslim."" I wear long thick tzitzit, and when I showed him he said ""Ohhh got it, yeah I guess I was just really excited to see another Muslim and didn't notice those. What do they mean?"" So I took a few minutes to share Torah and minhagim concerning tzitzit halacha, and he was like ..fascinated, I guess? He had no idea there was so much meaning behind them. He told me he has a 2 year old daughter and he's been married 4 years, and he's been in the US for 9 years now. I invited them for shabbos Friday, but he respectfully declined because his wife is ""really pregnant"" and she needs to rest most of the day. Which I totally get. I just let him know not to hesitate if he needs anything and we exchanged numbers and Instagram, he went to work and I went about my day. And I didn't think a whole lot about it until this afternoon. We had a moment of confusion over religious and cultural similarities. How often does something like that happen? And our confusion was completely washed away by our eagerness to know more about each other. That's rare, too, I thought. And then we set up a neighborly confidence, started a friendship, learned a bit about each other, and it felt really good. I'll be looking out for he and his family, and he'll be doing the same for us. Hashem's most important social law in action, between two men stuck in the grey area of the deep south. And I thought, you know, if he were Jewish I don't think I'd be any happier. I just wouldn't. There's something so much bigger and more important than all of that stuff when it comes to human connection. I'm really happy I have Palestinian family next door.

discussion,1c3yd37,757,,r/IsraelPalestine,"A lot of the rhetoric coming from the pro palestinian side seems to be that the Palestinians cannot be responsible for their own actions because they are oppressed. In my time in leftist circle I've seen this excuse used often,that the oppressed essentially cannot really be held responsible for their own actions. I think this was quite evident by the waves of left/liberal influences telling people to see the ""context"" behind the Oct 7th massacre.                

Many pro palestinians have also excused Oct 7th claiming that the Palestinians had no other choice because they are being oppressed, and I've seen the same excuses used for virtually any terror attack in the country before or since.                                  

On the flip side, many Israelis (myself included) believe that the Palestinians are in the situation they are in now because they refuse to stop perpetuating the cycle of violence and continue to encourage their kids to be violence toward Israelis/Jews.  Their violence leads to increased restrictions and aggression from the Israeli government. I believe it is their responsibility to stop trying to kill Israelis and stop teaching their children to be violent, otherwise they only have themselves to blame.                                     

But I'd venture to guess most Pro Palestinians do not believe that to be the case, so I want to ask, **is there ANYTHING within the control of the Palestinians that they can take responsibility for?** Or are they completely helpless and incapable of doing anything to change their situation aside from continuing the cycle of violence?                            

And in order to honestly answer this question you have to be aware of basic facts like the [martyr's fund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_Authority_Martyrs_Fund) and the fact Palestinians [teach](https://www.nationalreview.com/news/students-at-school-run-by-u-n-palestinian-aid-agency-boast-about-wanting-to-murder-jews-in-shocking-video/) [their](https://www.gov.il/en/Departments/General/hamas-mickey-mouse-teaches-children-to-hate-and-kill-10-may-2007) [children](https://unwatch.org/un-teachers-call-to-murder-jews-reveals-new-report/) [to](https://www.jpost.com/arab-israeli-conflict/palestinian-text-books-in-unwra-schools-reportedly-teach-of-killing-jews-472012) [kill](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/beltway-confidential/2451814/the-un-teaches-palestinian-children-to-murder-jews/).

opinion,172eldi,930,,r/IsraelPalestine,"We Jews are the people who survived the Shoah. 6,000,000 were murdered.  

At Babi Yar, in Ukraine, 33,711 Jews were massacred on September 29-30, 1941.

A month before, August 28-30, 1941, 23,600 Jews were murdered at Kamenets-Podolsk.

November 3-4, 1943, 42,000 Jews were murdered in Operation Harvest Festival.

If you think murdering 200 Jews on October 7, 2023 is going to change the course of our history, you are sorely mistaken.  You have shattered 200+ families and have achieved nothing but the death warrant of Hamas. 

If you think you can support Palestine but not Hamas, remember that Hamas was elected to rule the Gaza Strip.  Abbas and the PLO are in the 18th year of their 4 year term and won’t hold new elections in the W Bank because Hamas will win and they want to cling to power without the support of the people.  

This is the crux of the entire conflict:  there is no partner for peace for Israel; the Palestinian street wants Hamas and war and destruction.  Without Hamas, your political position would become reasonable; you should join us in the honorable and holy mission to permanently destroy Hamas, our common enemy.",2023-10-07 20:25:07,To Palestinian Sympathizers:,0.73,646,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/172eldi/to_palestinian_sympathizers/

An updated public Palestinian opinion poll was just published by ""The Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research"" led by Dr. Khalil Shikaki.

""With humanitarian conditions in the Gaza Strip worsening, support for Hamas declines in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip; and as support for armed struggle drops in both the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, support for the two-state solution rises in the Gaza Strip only. Nonetheless, wide popular support for October the 7th offensive remains unchanged and the standing of the Palestinian Authority and its leadership remains extremely weak.""

Also notable:
- Support for the Oct 7 attack remains around 70%.
- Only 5% think Hamas comitted atrocities, and that's only because they watched Hamas videos. Of those who didn't watch the videos, only 2% think Hamas comitted atrocities.
- UNRWA is responsible for around 60% of the shelters and is pretty corrupt (70% report discriminatory resource allocation).
- 56% thinks Hamas will emerge victorious.
- Only 13% wants the PA to rule Gaza. If Abbas is in charge, only 11% wants it. 59% wants Hamas in charge.

,172pypc,1583,,r/IsraelPalestine,"Today was the worst massacre of Jews since WW2.

&#x200B;

Today we saw what ""Free Palestine"" and ""From the River to the Sea"" really means.

&#x200B;

* Palestinians murdered, kidnapped, and raped innocent Jews on a holiday, 50 years to the date of the Yom Kippur War.
* Palestinians murdered 400 Jews and counting.
* Palestinians  raped, mutilated and paraded with the naked body of a Jewish woman that they murdered as if she was a trophy.
* Palestinians anally raped a teenage Jewish girl and kidnapped her to Gaza.
* Palestinians murdered seniors who were merely sitting at a bus stop.
* Palestinians kidnapped children who they will likely torture and murder.
* Palestinians are beheaded Jewish soldiers in the streets.
* Palestinians are stopped vehicles and slit the throats of the people in them.
* Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank are celebrating the massacre of Jews today.
* Palestinians around the world, such as in New York, London and Berlin, are celebrating the massacre of Jews today.
* Some of the images and videos we are seeing of Palestinians are similar to the works of other jihadis such as IS, Al Qaeda and the Taliban.

&#x200B;

If your takeaway from the massacre of 300 Jews is that the world has ignored the issue of a Palestinian state or some whataboutism, you are NOT a human rights advocate - YOU ARE AN ANTISEMITIC BIGOT. There is no justification for murder of innocent Jewish civilians. Land is not an excuse to pillage, rape, kidnap and murder,  especially when it wasn't their land to claim.

&#x200B;

The Palestinian cause has remained unevolved for 100 years and is an Antisemitic death cult, calling for the genocide of Jews. The irony is that Palestinian supporters scream cease-fire when Israel has to address the terrorism in Gaza but they will never condemn the rape, kidnapping and murder of innocent Jews which led to it.

&#x200B;

The 2 state solution is dead. The 1 state solution is dead.  You can thank Hamas, who was willfully elected by an overwhelming majority of Palestinians. Palestinians and their supporters have proved that they are not legitimate peace partners and at any opportunity, if they are not excusing the murder of innocent Jews, they are celebrating and/or partaking in it.

,1b1hjbx,212,,r/SocialistGaming,"I can't believe this needs to be said, but it does and I won't hear any arguments against it: 

Free Palestine from the River to the Sea is not an incitement of Genocide against Jewish People. 
It is a rallying call to restore political power and indigenous land back to the Native Palestinian People and to return political autonomy over their lives. 

It is a call to end Apartheid and to expel any illegal occupations from the Palestinian People's land. 

The Israeli State is an illegal occupation force which commits racial, ethnic, and Religious Violence against the Native Palestinian People whose religious affiliations range from Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, and many more. 

From the River to the Sea is a call to remove the occupiers from the land and restore political autonomy to the people who are being subjugated by the US Empire's Neo-Colonial pet. It is a call to end genocide and a call to end occupation. 

If you said ""from the southern coast to the Himalayas"" regarding  the British Colonial Occupation of India would you believe that was a call to Genocide the British? No because that would be stupid.

If you don't support a free and independent Palestinian People from the Israeli Occupation then you cannot and should not consider yourself a leftist let alone a socialist.

If this offends you, get the fuck out. And stay the fuck out. Zionism is Fascism and equating Zionism as an Ideology to the Jewish People is antisemitism.

OPdelta,17r8caw,866,,r/changemyview,"This is a common claim lately that Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinian people of Gaza. and have been attempting genocide for decades now.   


This claim has no sensible basis. I think there are are many ways I could tackle this but by far the strongest arguments against this claim is just in a review of the numbers.   


Hamas states the current death toll as around 11000 about 0.55% of the total population.   
The population of Gaza being 2 million.  
Also, Gaza is about as densely populated as Hong Kong.  
Therefore currently 99.45% of Gazans remain alive.

Israel has the military capability to nuke Gaza, but not only that they have enough conventional ordinance to do as much damage as nuke on Gaza would do. 

Gaza city specifically has a population of 590,481and is likely the most densely populated part of Gaza.

If Israel wanted to they could destroy that city entirely within a night and literally kill virtually the entire population. 

They haven't - therefore the only logical conclusion is that they are not attempting to kill as many civilians as they can and therefore are not committing a genocide.

,1843ord,404,,r/geopolitics,"The ""power gap"" between gaza and Israel was much MUCH less in 1967 than in 2023, for 4 reasons:

- In 6 day war a good portion of IDF was busy fighting in other fronts. In 2023 most of it is focused on gaza.

- Gaza was under Egyptian control and defended by Egyptian military. One cannot compare Egyptian military to Hamas. One is an arm of a large, non blockaded state and other is a rag tag militia which gets its weapons via smuggling. 

- Gaza was not a blockaded state struggling to even get basic supplies. Sending men and weapons to gaza was much easier. 

- Global support for Israel at that time was relatively less compared to today. 

Yet Israel managed to launch a ground invasion quickly and started from the north (just like in 2023). They reached khan yunus in 4 hours so we can safely assume all of gaza was conquered in less than 7 hours. 

But in 2023 it has been 1.5 months already and despite the much wider power gap they haven't even fully conquered half of gaza, let alone the whole of gaza strip

,176nj3r,981,,r/MapPorn,"On 1 April 2019, the Israeli authorities expanded the permissible fishing area along the southern and central parts of Gaza’s coast from six up to 15 nautical miles (NM) offshore, the furthest distance that Gaza’s fishers have been permitted to access since 2000. Access to the northern areas along the coast remain more limited at up to 6 NM, well below the 20 NM agreed under the Oslo Accords (see map).

Despite the improved access, the situation remains unpredictable: between April and October 2019, the fishing limits have been changed (i.e. reduced or extended) 14 times, including on three occasions when Israel announced a full naval closure that denied Palestinian fishers access to the sea following the launching of incendiary balloons towards Israel.

There is a direct correlation between the scope of access to the sea and the quantity and value of the fishing catch; the further out to sea fishers can go, the deeper the water and the higher the value of the fish caught (see chart 1). As a result of the increased access in recent months, the cumulative catch between January and August 2019 reached 2,357 metric tons (MT), a 34 per cent increase compared with the same period in 2018.[3]

He will not respond to reason. He went into medicine for this exact reason, to one day go to Gaza and help. The whole family is begging him not to go. I can’t stop crying and imagining the worst. They kill medical professionals all the time there, hundreds recently. He tells me they haven’t killed an American doctor “yet” and so I shouldn’t worry. This obviously isn’t comforting to me. He’s always been a risk taker but this seems so needless. I understand it’s been his life dream but also he can go when there’s not an active bombing campaign. He refuses this compromise. I feel he’s being selfish because it can wait until the bombing stops but no, he wants to go now. I’m angry, scared, of course proud of him but I’m just so scared. Just venting because I’m losing my mind. Any words of wisdom and comfort would be greatly appreciated:(

OPdelta,1bbox25,3681,,r/changemyview,"I'm not super educated in geopolitics and history. I think it should be easy to CMV. I just need to understand better because from the research I did it seemed pretty clear cut and obvious.

Hamas took control of Gaza in 2007. They provided some social services and now the care of the people who live there is under Hamas. Their safety and well-being is now in HAMAS's hands.

How did they take care of their people? Well by shooting missiles at a superior military for two decades. Then when they finally hit Israel a little too hard, and Israel dropped warnings to evacuate, HAMAS told their people it's a bluff and to ignore it... This seems super obvious that HAMAS has been doing this the whole time so that a big enough tragedy happens that they get attention and resources because of the tragedy. Public opinion shift was the goal. 

I understand that whole area has a very complicated history. I mean since ancient Mesopotamia crazy events have been taking place in that part of the world. I'm sure if you ask either party who started it, their answers will go back indefinitely since the dawn of civilization.

Is it not rational to assign responsibility during the leadership shift in 2007? I mean if aliens invaded with superior technology, and warned us not to attack, and one of our leaders commanded us to attack... And we get wiped out... That's poor leadership no? As much as we cry that the land should have been ours, the new military might situation requires strategy adjustment to protect lives. 

What am I missing here?

*Final edit*: Maybe a better question would have been ""What is the strategic value of guerrilla warfare and ongoing resistance to Israel from the Palestinian people?""

Early resistance made sense to me (1948-1970ish). Once Israel had finally captured strategic locations and proved their power, I would have expected more treaties or appeasements like the one Egypt did.

I also understand the sentiment from many of you that picking a specific time in history to evaluate that leadership and it's strategic choices is arbitrary. Some of you think it makes much more sense to focus on the immediate pulling of a trigger version of cause and effect. 

In the same way you should ""expect"" a certain response when attacking a superior military, in the 1940s the winners of world war II should have ""expected"" endless generations of resistance to that proposed occupation. And to be prepared for that cost is, somewhat, to be prepared for the full extermination of your enemy if they do not yield. And if you *know* they won't yield, then maybe that is genocide. Hindsight is 20/20 in this realm of fault being assigned to ""should have known"" future outcomes. I am now agnostic of fault here, and becoming increasingly solemn the more footage I watch. 

PM me or reply again if I missed a deserved delta.

,18zrsr1,2432,,r/popularopinion,"Hamas is the worst thing to ever happen to Palestine. They've stolen billions of dollars that could have gone to education and humanitarian efforts, and spent it on digging tunnels and buying weapons to kill Israelis. They cowardly hide behind civilians and then cry genocide when the bullets and bombs that were intended for them strike children or homes. Their leaders live in luxury, far away from conflict, gluttonously burning through Palestinian funds.

October 7th was verification that Hamas can not exist in a two state solution. Israel has no other option but to remove them from the equation. Any other possible scenario would be signing the death certificates of countless Israeli civilians.

It's horrible, and what the Palestinians in Gaza are going to go through is nothing short of Hell. But Hamas must go, or surrender. If Hamas laid down their guns, there would be a two state solution. If Israel laid down their guns, it would be genocide.


Edit: I don't believe that the elimination of Hamas will immediately make a two-state solution possible. Palestine could never (at least in the next 50 years) provide their own defense forces. But neutralizing Hamas could possibly leave a vacancy for a leadership that might be able to begin some kind of peace process and, hopefully, generate some economic growth that would support something resembling a free governing Palestine.

Edit: Downvote the shit out of this. I don't care. Every downvote is a verification of another person who is comfortable supporting terrorism. 

Also, the ratio of civilians to military personnel killed only verifies the TRUE narrative that Hamas likes to kill Israelis and then abscond back to their favorite hiding spots - behind their own civilians (which is a war crime in and of itself). They built their headquarters underneath a hospital for fucks sake. You don't get to commit acts of terror and then hide behind elementary schools and food pantries, and then cry genocide when the bombs that were aimed at you strike a civilian occupied establishment. 

Israel WILL win this conflict, and thank God our western governments aren't braindead enough to fall victim to the Jew-hating, pro-terrorism rhetoric. I hate what is happening to Palestinians, but I hate Hamas for it. If Hamas had the balls to build military bases safely *away* from heavily civilian occupied areas (you know, like militaries that *aren't* internationally prescribed terrorist organizations), then I might have a sliver of respect for them.

Since 7/10 there have been cadres of ultra-pro-Palestine editors on Wikipedia who have been singularly focused on painting Israel as the evil aggressor. [Certain prominent editors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Nishidani) with more than 100,000 edits to Wikipedia [openly support Hamas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Nableezy).

# Euro-Med Monitor's disinformation campaign

These pro-Palestine Wikipedia editors know that if they go too far towards the pro-Palestine side in one instance, then there may be sanctions against them. Instead, what they do is they delegitimize reliable sources and promote pro-Palestine opinion sources. For example, in the [page for the Israel-Hamas war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel%E2%80%93Hamas_war), they cite the [Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor](https://euromedmonitor.org/en) (Euro-Med) to falsely claim that 90% of casualties were civilians. [On the surface, the Euro-Med Monitor looks like a generic human rights organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro-Mediterranean_Human_Rights_Monitor) however, the Euro-Med Monitor has actually been a significant source of pro-Hamas propaganda on social media. In fact, it is owned by a man named Ramy Abdu, who [is a literal Hamas lobbyist](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/clare-short-at-risk-of-arrest-in-israel-warns-defence-minister-moshe-ya-alon-a828401.html). [His Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramy_Abdu) seems awfully one-sided. Why is that? Well, a prominent contributor to both his article and the Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor article is [Wikipedia user Anassjerjawi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Anassjerjawi). Guess who is also named Anass Jerjawi? [The Chief Operating Officer of Euro-Med.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anas-aljerjawi-0660a8156/?originalSubdomain=ps) Other prominent contributors to Euro-Med's Wikipedia page are [Maha Hussaini](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mahahussaini/?originalSubdomain=ps) and [Nesma Jaber](https://www.middleeasteye.net/user/17766), both contributors at the [Qatari-funded Middle East Eye newspaper](https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/article-739067). There are also 8 other unknown Wikipedia editors who have edited Euro-Med's page with pro-Palestine edits, some of whom have edited other pro-Palestine and human rights-related Wikipedia articles. Why is this so pervasive? The answer is that Euro-Med actually has a program in which they get 40 Palestinian university students to [edit English](https://euromedmonitor.org/en/article/4991/Euro-Med-Monitor-launches-second-round-of-the-WikiRights-project-in-the-West-Bank-and-Gaza) and [Italian Wikipedia](https://euromedmonitor.org/en/article/4988/Training-course-for-Italian-speakers-on-promoting-human-rights-on-Wikipedia,-within-%E2%80%98WikiRights%E2%80%99) every year.

# How Palestine supporters influence Wikipedia

The situation with Euro-Med is just one particularly egregious example, but the ways in which Palestine supporters influence Wikipedia are generally much more subtle. For example, [Elie Wiesel's article](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Elie_Wiesel&oldid=1188383405#Support_for_Israeli_government_policy) previously claimed that ""Following his death, Wiesel was criticized by some for his perceived silence on certain Israeli government policies with regards to the Palestinians."" The source for this is [an OPINION article from Mondoweiss, an explicitly pro-Hamas website.](https://mondoweiss.net/2016/07/mainstream-intolerant-palestinians/) The only people criticizing Wiesel here is the \*\*author of the opinion piece.\*\* Using this same logic, I could cite a Stormfront Forum post and say ""Wiesel was criticized by some for being a Jew."" Another example is the article for [Ramy Abdu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramy_Abdu), the founder of Euro-Med and a Hamas lobbyist, it says that he is a ""human rights advocate."" The citation for this [is an article](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/mec/2020/01/02/middle-east-banks-neglect-human-rights-implications-of-their-business-practices/) that \*\*Abdu himself wrote.\*\* This clearly violates Wikipedia's guidelines about self-published sources. By this logic, I could make a Wikipedia article and cite a website I just made that says that I am human rights advocate.

# Double standards

In 2013, the pro-Israel website ""NGO Monitor"" [was banned from being used as a source on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources/Noticeboard/Archive_159#Reliability_of_references_to_Gerald_Steinberg_and_to_his_NGO_Monitor). Although I agree with NGO Monitor, it is clearly a biased source, and is not suitable for use on Wikipedia, an unbiased website. [NGO Monitor's Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGO_Monitor) clearly states at the beginning that it is ""pro-Israel."" When an organization such as the ADL is cited on a Wikipedia article related to Israel-Hamas, [it is very frequently referred to as a ""pro-Israel"" group whenever it is cited in an article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparisons_between_Israel_and_Nazi_Germany). On the other hand, [when Euro-Med is cited in an article, it is simply listed as the ""Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor.""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refaat_Alareer) This is despite Euro-Med's clear pro-Palestine bias.

Most people don't go past the headline. When people hover over the page for Euro-Med, they see: ""**Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor** is an independent, [nonprofit organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization) for the protection of [human rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights)."" Their immediate reaction is that Euro-Med is similar to an organization like Amnesty International. On the other hand, when people hover over the page for NGO Monitor, they see: ""**NGO Monitor** (**Non-governmental Organization Monitor**) is a [right-wing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing) [non-governmental organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-governmental_organization) based in [Jerusalem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem) that reports on international NGO activity from a pro-Israel perspective."" Their immediate reaction is that anything NGO Monitor says is unreliable.

\*\*The two organizations are equally biased, but only one of them, NGO Monitor is clearly depicted as being biased. The other one, Euro-Med, is cited all across Wikipedia despite having never been cited by any credible mainstream news organization.\*\*

# How can this be fixed?

Therein lies the problem with Wikipedia. If 4 out of every 5 users editing an Israel-Palestine Wikipedia article is pro-Palestine, \*of course\* the articles will have a pro-Palestine slant. Wikipedia operates based on a consensus decision-making process, and pro-Palestine editors dominate the consensus. The only body that regulates the conduct of these users is [the Wikipedia Arbitration Committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitration_Committee_(Wikipedia)), a largely unbiased group of editors that makes sure that editors stay within the consensus decision-making process. But when the consensus decision-making process is fundamentally corrupted, then the power of pro-Palestine editors can go unchecked. Simply put: there need to be more pro-Israel English Wikipedia editors.

# Real-world impacts

The impact of this is that an entire generation of internet users becomes subtly brainwashed by pro-Palestine propaganda. The situation is analogous to [when Holocaust Deniers took over the Croatian Wikipedia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FiHDo5bqNXw), and controlled it from 2011 to 2020. This \*can't not\* have had an effect on Croatian society. In 2020, the far-right ultranationalist Homeland Party won 11 seats in the Croatian parliament, and 2 days ago they won 14 seats. The rise of the Homeland Party can't be directly attributed to the fascist takeover of Croatian Wikipedia - other far-right parties in Europe arose around the same time for a variety of factors. However, the fascist takeover almost certainly did poison the thinking of hundreds of thousands of young Croats who used Croatian Wikipedia every day.

I'm worried that a cabal of pro-Palestine Wikipedia editors will irreversibly and irreparably harm the public's image of Israel.

,1780dpz,655,,r/geopolitics,"Hello I’m here for discussion,
I’m going to give you my perspective, as someone who grew up in the Middle East, and also very close to Israel, I’ve grown up with the knowledge that Palestine is occupied by Israel, I adapted to the idea of Israel but I was always scolded by my colleagues in occupied territories who always told me it’s occupied Palestine. I read more about it and came to know more about the ethnic cleansing and displacement that happened to Palestinians and grew unresting feelings towards Israel; don’t get me wrong this isn’t an antisemitism thing, I respect all religions and condemn all violence and killing of people but for me it’s a humanitarian issue it’s an occupier vs occupied kind of thing and I always felt bad for Palestinians cause the media always portrayed them as the bad people in every conflict. 
Now I do understand Israelis desire to live and the interest of its own people and I respect that, the atrocities it’s doing to Gaza people is awful
From our perspective or people around me, we believe Hamas is doing everything it can to keep Israel away from occupying Gaza, nobody understands why Hamas actually attacked and really most people are against the occupation and not people. Some people believe hammas attacked because some settlers entered into Al Aqua mosque which is considered holy. Palestinians are scared of the idea that they’d lose this holy mosque as it’s very important to them and it’s already tired of occupying force always trying to expand
However reading some of the responses about hamas made me rethink a few things and I want to know what it’s like from your perspective

OPdelta,17o9tyn,2396,,r/changemyview,"I just want to say at the outset that I am talking about the political leadership of both sides.  I have nothing but sympathy for the civilian victims of this conflict and any other war for that matter.  I also want to say that I understand that wars are inherently evil undertakings but there are times where there is a clear aggressor and a clear victim.  I would count the current conflict in Ukraine among those.  

I was born in the Russian-speaking Eastern portion of Ukraine in 1980 and I am still in touch with many relatives over there.  I know people who have gone all in for Putin and his narrative of “Nazism” in Ukraine (I also have relatives who moved to Israel in the 1990s, they have excommunicated me for my opposition to Israeli militarism).  People who support Russia’s invasion of Ukraine are among the most gullible and least intellectually curious people on the face of the earth.  Russia is clearly the bad guy.     

With that out of the way, to me there is no clear “good side” in the entire Israel-Palestine conflict. Why do I say so?

Let’s start with Israel.  Displacing an indigenous population with settlers is a real 17th century move.  What the fuck did you expect when you opened up a “safe haven” for Jewish people in the Middle East?  And your claim that the Bible gives this venture legitimacy to some ""promised land for Jews"" is just laughable.  The Bible also says that a guy put two of every species of a wooden boat, the Bible says that a lady turned into a pillar of salt.  I don’t think that the Bible is a valid document for making political claims. 

 After forcibly removing the local Palestinian population the Israelis settlers forced them into smaller and smaller reservations, essentially mirroring what white settlers did to native populations in North America.  Is it any surprise that people are pissed off, that this has resulted in a lot of violence and death?  Could there have been any other outcome?  Maybe they should have tried what South Africa did in the 1990s, instead of doubling down on apartheid and oppression.  

As for the Palestinian leadership, I am certainly sympathetic to their cause, but their approach is just disgusting without fail.   Going back to the 1970s as far as I know, they have been consistently targeting innocents: [athletes in the 1972 Munich Olympics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich_massa), [1990s suicide bombings of buses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Palestinian_suicide_attacks), and now [this sickening attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Hamas_attack_on_Israel) that happened a couple of weeks ago. 

A lot of my left-leaning friends will say, “how can we tell an oppressed people how they should resist oppression?”, to which I say, “we can’t, but we sure as shit don’t have to support this!”  And, of course, look at Gandhi and Martin Luther King!  These guys were able to take on far more powerful and wealthier opponents because they refused to meet violence with violence and were able to expose the inherently brutal nature of racism and colonialism for the world to see. 

And at the end of the day, it is a popularity contest.  Palestine has a cause that any rational person would see as just but when they commit terrible acts against innocent people, it’s easy to lose sight of that.  Especially if you are courting the favor of fickle and easily distracted American voters.  Which is something they ought to be doing.  Whether it should be this way or not, it would be extremely beneficial to their struggle if there were popular demand in Western societies to support a free Palestine.  

But violence is not only ugly, it also does not work.  Can you imagine if Gandhi or MLK had taken beheaded hostages or kidnapped athletes or bombed a crowded bus, the retribution taken upon their followers and the populations they claimed to represent would have been swift and terrible.

Just as we are seeing in Gaza now.  This does not make it OK, of course, but it was absolutely to be expected.  If the Israelis have proven one thing to be true since 1947, it’s that they are pretty tough in a fight.  So, I think that we can say that violence should be a non-starter for any Palestinian leader and I’m going to say, I have absolutely zero sympathy for any of their leadership that undertakes attacks on Israeli civilians. 

  
Can anyone change my view?  Am I wrong to not be able to see one of these sides as better than the other?

It's very complicated but based on the information I was able to absorb, it seemed like a lot of people were standing with Palestine, which makes sense because of everything Israel has been doing. But then I learned about Hamas and read that they started the attacks in the first place? And now I'm seeing people say that Israel is acting in defense, which in turn led to me seeing a lot of people stand with Israel. I've seen people say that Hamas are terrorists, people say they're not terrorists and the Israelis are.

Since Hamas' attacks on Israel back in October, we've seen a flush of users that were not previously active participants in our subreddit, and also encouraged a lot of hate speech previously unseen here. As moderators, we read the same arguments in favor of each side repeatedly since the war broke out again in the region.

We know that the Palestine Question is one of the most heated discussions on the Internet, and also one that influences the political lives of many, both inside Israel or Palestine, and outside of it. However, we've seen that users rarely maintain civility, and moderators are not able to properly maintain civil discourse compared to other topics.

That said:

* Until said otherwise, **any** post related to Israel, Palestine, and the war in the region will be **removed**. Insistence on posting such content will be met with warnings and bans if necessary.

* News of extraordinary importance not only to Europe - **which must be related** - but to the whole world can still be shared. Our criteria will be how many websites, from news agency (AP, Reuters) to international newspapers (Euronews, NYT, France24, and others), share **original reporting** on it.

Why do you feel so passionate about Israel in particular? (I've seen more people post about Palestine than the war in Ukraine, SCOTUS ripping away womens rights, armenian genocide, etc. - why? I'll try to make this quick but Israel is a small piece of land, casualties are far lower than other world conflicts, etc.. Why is Israel the topic you care about most? It seems anti-semetic, no?)

Isn't it hypocritcal to support the erradication of Jewish people from the land? And if you don't think its hypocritical, where else do you reccomend these people go? (The bible is based there so they obviously have an ancient connection to this land - why would you rule them out as completely undeserving?)

If you're American, our country sucks right now, but why do you care more about Israel than everything going on in America? I make this conclusion because everyone is posting about Israel but no one is sharing Instagram stories about SCOTUS, rising inflation, corporate curroption, capatalism, etc.. I see people protesting and shutting down highways and it feels hypocritical to have such a privlage to live in a nation where you can do that while supporting Hamas, a terrorist organization that would view that as a crime.

,1bu4dve,1395,,r/thedavidpakmanshow,"Since January 1st, it's been an election year, and a quite stressful one to be precise. A first since 1956, an election repeat matchup is awaiting us on November 5th. #45 Vs #46. 

We know them head-and-shoulders. We've seen both as Presidents and we have fallen victims (or beneficiaries) of their policy. But attention is paid on Mr. Trump, a person almost objectively dangerous for American interests and the greatest virtue of them all: DEMOCRACY. 

His presidential actions have systematically put this institution at major existential risk here in America - more profoundly on J6 -, and despite all of this, his views, actions, issues and his entire Presidentcy, he's currently leading in the polls 7 months to go. And the response to the ongoing Israel-Palestine conflict is to blame. 

Since the October 7th attack, Mr. President has taken an almost unanimous staunch in favour of Israel, with regards to the de-activation of the HAMAS organisation. Albeit certain private clashes between Biden and Netanyahu and the President's public backing of the 'Two-State Solution', his support to Israel is almost unconditional. And this annoys the youth and the Muslims, two voting blocks that helped him triumph over Trump 4 years ago (mostly the former category though). 

They seem to have been enormously sensibilised over this conflict. Israel's response looks heinous to them and there is evidence to support this. As a result, they show tendancy to refrain from voting over Biden's position in this conflict, allowing Trump to win. 

We cannot afford to lose our sacred Democracy over this. Our rule of law, our well-being, our leadership. We know what another Trump term will bring, and there is a huge chance it will be EVEN WORSE. 

I am using this platform to promote the concept that President Biden must listen to the YOUTH and follow, dare I say blindly, their advice. Democracy is on the ballot with a finite effect. A Trump victory puts a decisive end to the America we know, whilst leaving zero harriers for the country's improvement. Their massive voting rally elected him in 2020 and stopped the so-called 'Red Wave' two years later. Their absence will cost us ALL. 

Our President is called to play by their rules, as the alternative is lethal. I can't afford Democracy to be lost forever over this, so he better just LISTEN TO THEM! 

There's enough time for him to do so. In other case, I'd like to see him pass the torch early to another Democratic nominee. 


PS: I view myself as a centrist and progressive, refraining from right-wing and left-wing views. 

PS: Personally speaking, my priority on foreign policy is the situation in Ukraine, found at its current state thanks to Republican treasoning. As for the Israel/Palestine conflict, I stand neutral, supporting the Two-State solution, as both deserve statewood status. I denounce the extremism on both sides though and I wish for its complete eradication. I am neither Pro-Israel nor Pro-Palestine, but current circumstances force me to stand by the youth, even if I find their response exaggerated in cases. At the end of the day, I just want Democracy to survive whatever it takes.

announcement ,1bdxhl5,57,,r/polandball,"Hello minions of the subreddit!

Ever since the latest Israel/Palestine conflict started a lot of people have wanted to make comics about it. That's natural, it's a hot topic and current geopolitical issue that lends itself to polandball comics.

However, what we've seen to an extent we're frankly annoyed with is that a lot of people making comics about Israel and Palestine lately do it mostly as rage bait, intentionally trying to be as inflammatory as they can and getting people angry for fun. In short, they've forgotten that the comics actually have to be *funny* as well.

Additionally, the topic of Israel and Palestine brings out the worst in Redditors. Any time a comic about the topic is posted we have to put out fires in the comment sections, hand out bans, track brigades, and tell people to chill the fuck out (to no avail). Not only do the posters forget that this is a comedy subreddit, the comment sections do as well. And frankly, we're tired of it.

Thus, we are **raising the bar** on comics relating to the Israel/Palestine conflict!

What this means in practice is that comics about Israel/Palestine are not banned, but we will be reviewing such comics much more critically than other posts, and remove them if we feel like they don't add anything meaningful, interesting or funny to the topic.

We also will not be reviewing any approval requests using Israel/Palestine as the subject matter, with exception to approval comics that were submitted to us before this post was made.

,1c2lsxm,196,,r/PoliticalDebate,"Do you think Hamas would accept a ceasefire if given one?

I personally don't think they would. This situation reminds me a lot of the Vietnamese fight for independence. Their goal is basically to drag Israel into a prolonged fight and break their morale. They ""win by not losing"", is how I've heard it put. And with backing from Iran and support from Hezbollah and Ansar-Allah, it would seem surprising to me that they simply give up, especially now that Gaza has been all but destroyed. All they can do is fight to the death at this point.

But I'm not sure Israel will run out of morale like the US did in the Vietnam war. The general public of Israel seems much more openly pro-military force than the US was in the 60s. After all this conflict has been going on for decades, and militancy is certainly a founding principal of Zionism, the idea that the Jewish people must be protected through use of force.

I think the turning point in this conflict will be if the US has a change of policy and starts distancing themselves from Israel.",2024-04-12 22:09:28,"Israel-Palestine Ceasefire, likely?",0.56,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDebate/comments/1c2lsxm/israelpalestine_ceasefire_likely/

Frankly, I feel that the guy needs to leave now, not ""after the war"", because the guy comes across as a massive liability and he's still mired in that whole corruption scandal. And yes, there is a good argument that Israel are definitely reckless with their bombings. 

That said, one side is still definitely worse than the other and there's so much infuriating claims made by the online left in defence of Hamas. I've felt especially mad when I've seen so many users on Leftie subreddits and on Twitter unironically claim that the hostages Hamas were shown to be forcing at gunpoint into Al Shifa hospital were purely going in for medical treatment, and not in fact Hamas using the hospital for holding and killing hostages. 

Also right now there are a sizeable amount of pro Palestine people online who are engaging in 9/11 style conspiracies about Oct 7 by claiming that the IDF did it all, and I haven't seen this sort of stuff denounced at all by any of the Pro Palestine people on X or in any videos of speeches at rallies. Add in the recent viral reposting of the Bin Laden letter and the fact that many of the Pro Palestine people don't seem to be intellectually honest enough to admit what would almost certainly happen to a vast amount of Jews in Israel if the powers in Palestine achieve what they're aiming for, and it's why I ultimately end up having to side with Israel on this issue.

I find that people who support Israel in this conflict appear way more willing to also criticise the actions of the Israeli government, whereas the same seems far more rare for the pro Palestine side, with people ironically advocating for solutions (like One State) that would kill bucketloads of Palestinians, which is what they claim to be against.

EDIT: To be clearer about my criticisms of the Pro Palestine side, it's that for all the claims of ""genocide"" occuring in the area, it strikes me that the definition seems to apply way more to what Hamas has been doing to Israeli Jews through their terrorist attacks and through their explicitly stated goals to keep on brutally killing, torturing, r@ping, etc as many Jews as they can. The pro-Palestine side, however, appear to be way more reluctant to label what Hamas is doing as genocide, while extending next to no charitability to the IDF's actions in Gaza. The fact that there isn't a single Muslim majority country in the Middle East that has a thriving Jewish population, and that those countries all actually did ethnically cleanse and massacre the Jewish people from their countries, appear to be inconvenient facts that the Pro Palestine side often ignores.

And while this next part may be one hell of an over simplistic analysis, but to me Hamas and their leadership are no different to Hitler and the Nazis: The Nazis hated and wanted to kill and did kill Jewish people, LGBT people, women who wanted liberation, and free speech advocates. Hamas hate and want to kill and are killing Jewish people, LGBT, women who want liberation, and free speech advocates. The Israeli state may not be perfect, but holy shit is it way better especially for those wanting to exercise those types of rights than under Hamas.

As an example, here's a quote from an article which [I've recently read on the subject](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/03/us/politics/biden-white-house-ramadan-israel-gaza.html)

> Mr. Biden’s stance has angered crucial constituencies in Mr. Biden’s base, including young people, Black voters and progressives.

How much truth is there in this statement? My prior assumptions is usually that most Americans do not really care much about foreign policy unless they feel like it directly affects them (so in this scenario, my assumption was that the Gaza war would only really affect voting behaviors amongst Arab and Jewish Americans)

However, lots of media outlets seem to be contradicting this by suggesting that Black voters in particular are outraged by Biden's position on the I/P issue. 

I was wondering if anyone familiar with the community or access to relevant polling data could pipe up? Do Black voters really overwhelmingly approve of Biden on this issue?

What I can’t get over is how *pornographic* the coverage of the fighting has been. The video of the bleeding woman in her pajamas. The dead woman in her underwear on the back of the truck. The half-naked ravers with Hamas paratroopers descending in the background. The compilation of missing female soldiers' faces circulating. 

There's a constant refrain on Hamas murdering *and raping* despite there technically being no verified accounts of rape as of writing this. I’m not naive. I know there has but the fact that it jumped to everyone’s mind immediately is interesting. You didn’t see the Russian invasion of Ukraine described in those terms even though it’s definitely an element. Combat footage and gore abound for that conflict but didn’t pierce the veil of mainstream media like it is for this conflict.

As an American Jewish male, Israel has already been sexualized and presented to me as an oasis of tan beautiful women with machine guns slung across their backs. Taglit Birthright is basically advertised as sex tourism for suburban Jews. Also, it’s an open secret that there’s a commodified form of quasi-rape ingrained in the social structure of the IDF.

There’s also this bizarre form of lust I see in people when they describe Gaza and Palestinians. Particularly when they make fun of people for saying things like “LGTBQ for Palestine” or something. They seem to get off on describing how they’d be beheaded and stoned if they ever set foot in a Palestinian town. They fantasize about hypothetical honor killings and child brides.

I know nothing about psychology but I know that intellectuals like W. E. B. DuBois have written about the sexual anxiety undergirding racism. It seems to be in play here too but I’m having trouble connecting all the loose threads so I figured I’d share my impressions in the hopes that it resonates and some of you can express it a bit more coherently.

,17j2957,290,,r/ukpolitics,"- UK made significant concessions that took political courage. Releasing prisoners, amnesty’s, permitting a referendum to give secession to Northern Ireland. Facing down the Unionist intransigence (the DUP rejected the GFA). The Queen shook hands with a man who probably ordered the murder of her uncle. Dismantled the RUC and replaced it with a new police body.  Major had to contest against his own extremists in the Conservative Party. At the time Michale Gove published a paper calling for tanks on the ground and airstrikes in Northern Ireland along with incursions into Ireland.  

- Ireland: changed the Constitution after a referendum and gave up its territorial claim to the 6 Counties which is no small concession to give. There was a reference written into the Constitution claiming the North as lost territory.

- EU: helped via funding and gave a safe forum for back channel discussions to happen with mid level civil servants and diplomats when officially the big bosses couldn’t talk 

- Sinn Fein: didn’t give into the hardliners in the IRA. Martin McGuinness and Gerry Adams’s were threatened with assassination and labeled as traitors. Destroyed arms, shook hands with their sworn enemies and tried to run a new state. 

- UUP/SDLP: did a lot to keep the moderate positions viable, got electorally destroyed for taking politically courageous decisions but their legacy is the peace they helped bring about.

- DUP: did sweet fuck all and were dragged kicking and screaming into it and later claimed all the credit.

I appreciate that Jon, Jon, Dan and Tommy all call for allowing aid to Palestinians, and I appreciate that they criticize Bibi and his government, and that they say they want peace for Palestinians. And, of course, they are absolutely right to condemn Hamas, and feel immense sympathy for Israel after this horrendous tragedy. 

However. 

As a young leftist voter, donor to the pod, and supporter of the movement to free Palestine, I feel the pod has failed to cover this fairly by the omission of the responsibility the Israeli Government has in this.

First, the pod has joined many in calling the fact that Israel helped fund Hamas in the 1970's a ""conspiracy theory"". While Israel didn't not give Hamas weapons or ""create"" it, you CANNOT deny that it had a heavy hand in it: Mehdi Hasan, a reputable journalist, wrote an article for The Intercept, a reputable news source, in 2018 quoting multiple Israeli and American government officials. First is Brig. Gen. Yitzhak Segev of Israel was quoted by the New York times saying that Israel funded Hamas as a ""counterwieght"" to secularism groups that were quickly growing in the 1970's. Later, Yasser Arafat of Palestine would also accuse Israel of ""creating Hamas"" (though I wouldn't go as far as saying that). Avner Cohen, a former Israeli religious affairs official, has also called Hamas a creation of Israel and told the WSJ that he penned an official report asking his superiors not to work on a divide and conquer strategy in Palestine by trying to destabilize Gaza. 

What about any of that sounds illegitimate? Am I lacking in some necessary skepticism and critical thinking/research skills? 

Likewise, the pod talks about the killing and raping of civilians as though it's a one way street. Many Palestinians homes have been burned down, many kids have been brutally murdered by Israeli militants, and many women have been raped. They've mentioned the Nakba briefly on the pod, but don't talk about it with the actual weight that it carries. The massacres that occurred which Israel still denied ever happened despite how well documented they are. Likewise, the pod talks about hoping that the Israeli government will have mercy on civilians, and reluctantly says Israel has a right to defend itself when in the same breath they talk mention the blocking of aid, power, water food, etc... to Palestine. OF COURSE Israel has the right to defend itself, but we all know that's not what Netenyahu intends to do. Hell, Netenyahu loved Ayn Rand so much he got multiple architecture degrees. He and his defense minister have called Palestinians cave dwelling barbarians. 

I'm probably over reacting, because I know they're well intentioned, but this irks me just a bit...

But since it is under discussion here, and Sam talks about it, I want to address a point that I think is getting wildly misunderstood. This isn't a war of religion. It is fundamentally a war of nationalism / colonialism. This conflict began after WW1 as a fight between the British, who post-Balfour declaration were determined to support a Jewish state as a sort of colonial project, and the native Arabs. The British effort was assisted and eventually taken over by Jewish settlers, especially after WW2 when Britain tried to wash their hands of the whole affair. 

The entire time, the struggle was over the land of Palestine, and who got to live on it. Yes, the two people were divided by religion and religion has become a key part of the rhetoric. But the fundamental issue has always been this: Arab Palestinians resisting Jewish settlement of Palestine for two primary reasons: 1) Jewish desire to displace the native population in order to settle their land and 2) Jewish desire for a state that is fundamentally Jewish and thus cannot include a majority Arab population.

So no, this isn't about ""Jihadism"" or ""Islamic fundamentalism"". Those things became prominent in Palestine *because of* the pre-existing conflict. They are not the reason for the conflict. Sam has a major, major blind spot around the roots of Middle Eastern conflict and terrorism, and I see many of the people on this sub-reddit making the same mistake.",2023-10-16 15:29:35,Misconception of Israel-Palestine,0.47,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/samharris/comments/1797anj/misconception_of_israelpalestine/

discussion,1bx4qau,94,,r/IsraelPalestine,"what will the region look like in 2050? will there be a two-state solution? I'm looking at the trends, and this is what I see: 

first, demographic data, birth rates, and cultural trends point towards the Israeli population becoming less European and less liberal. with time, it will become an ultra Orthodox state, jewish, but similar to Iran or Saudi Arabia as a theocracy, unrecognizable as a western democracy. at some point along this road, there will be a greater disconnect from Jews in the US and Western Europe, and Israeli will become one of the boys, one of the numerous Arab states quarrelling with other Arab states, scheming against each other, hatching alliances, this may actually help with its long-term survival. another way to say this is that Israel will assimilate into the larger culture of the Middle East and Arab world, which is marked by lack of democracy, religious extremism, and internecine warfare.


second, the genocide Israel is committing in Gaza will create an entire generation of Palestinians and Arabs that will hate Israel, and for legitimate reasons. likewise, any sympathy Israel and Jews across the world have received because of their treatment during the Holocaust will diminish as people begin to see Israelis as capable of committing the same types of atrocities as the Germans. this will be a major liability. Israel may become a pariah State like South Africa due to its apartheid-like treatment of Arabs within its borders. or the West (hypocritical) will pretend to hold its nose and deal with Israel much like it does with other states in the region with less than stellar human rights records.

third, during the ensuing decades, settlements on the west bank will continue to expand until all the Arabs on the West Bank are displaced and Israeli settlers occupy the entire West bank. something similar will happen in Gaza as Israel slowly encroaches from the north. with most Arabs removed from West Bank and Gaza or living there but without land rights, Israelis will begin to turn on each other. they're already doing that, but without these two flashpoints within its aspirational borders, this will escalate.

4th, the moral character of the nation will continue to deteriorate. it started off bad with the ethnic cleansing of Arabs, but the routine violation of international law on the West Bank, now the genocide in gaza, torture of prisoners, the rapes and sexual humiliations of Arabs, the looting, will further corrode Judaism in israel. the immorality tarnishes a people and has reverberations through multiple subsequent generations. again, it will become more like other Arab states. Jews from around the world who have these inclinations will move to israel, while Israelis who see the moral sickness in their country will emigrate. this is happening right now in slow motion. 

fifth, demographics will also increase the size of Israel's Arab neighbors making the country more susceptible to being overrun again especially as Western support wanes. Population projections for 2050 are Egypt at 147 million, Israel at 15 million, turkey at 103 million, and Iran at 99 million. the projection for the Palestinian territories is 10 million, but considering that Israel will continue to push Palestinians off of their land, this population will be either in Jordan or Egypt or incorporated into Israel proper. being the little kid on the block, Israel may use it smarts to form alliances and play one Arab State off against another.

six, democracy will decrease. it is happening now. netanyahu almost became a dictator. it was a close call. the next time he or someone like him will be successful, and then Israel becomes like turkey or Syria or egypt.

,178y66p,599,,r/samharris,"I'm going to start by saying my knowledge of the conflict is lacking and I have been reading a lot to try and understand the background. I do have an immediate affinity for Israel because of my background, but realise that this is not based on a strong knowledge of the past and current issues. However these are some of the questions I am hoping people on this sub can give some insight to.

1) Why don't Palestine's neighbours take them in? It seems that Jordan is to some extent the most likely candidate, but they are surrounded by Islamic countries that could take them in. One commentor mentioned that they have essentially stoked rebellion and terrorism in every country they have been allowed into, like Lebanon and Jordan for example. But in general why is there not greater pressure on Islamic countries to make a plan. Quite frankly there is no other Jewish country, but there are plenty of Islamic countries (yes I know all of Islam is not the same, but that's not really the point).

2) Have the Palestinians ever in good faith accepted or tried to accept a peace deal or solution? It seems every time Israel has made concessions, the Palesinians have walked away from the table and have stated many times they will not accept any deal that gives Israel a right to exist.

3) It's been widely reported that ""Israel created Hamas."" However it seems that the nuance is lacking here. Is it not true that they supported the creation of Hamas as an alternative to what they saw as a more immediate and better organised threat, and that they felt they were better able to control Hamas? A sort of ""the enemy of my enemy"" situation.

4) How often has Israel been the primary aggressor? It seems that ,more often than not, Israel is attacked and then, in defending themselves, secure more territory, which they have also given back a few times.  It seems clear at least in some cases that Israel overstepped and launched ""preemptive"" strikes. They also seem to view all the wars and conflicts as a response to either imminent threats or actions by terrorists groups such as kidnappings, bombings or attempted assasination. I guess you can argue that to start a war over a country harbouring and supporting terrorists is a stretch (here's looking at you USA), but Israel is hardly the only country to try to preemptively protect themselves.",2023-10-16 05:54:22,Some questions that are bothering me about Israel/Palestine,0.71,86,https://www.reddit.com/r/samharris/comments/178y66p/some_questions_that_are_bothering_me_about/

,1bj4vaf,269,,r/Destiny,"I actually feel sorry for Destiny when I watch him flounder in an attempt to dwell on what might've been 'optically' improved in his presentation, although he's slowly starting to come to terms with the truth of this conflict, having previously said after being amazed at all the fabrications coming from 'Humanitarian organization/publications' or even the UN against Israel that if he was Israeli he might've gone insane and joined the far-right, and now gradually realizing more and more that nothing he ever says could possibly appease or convince the Anti-Zionists mobs.

He opened a Pandora's box when he delved into this issue, something well-known to many Jews or Israelis, but unbeknown to him at the time - this isn't like any other 'controversy' or contested ideology or idea he's ever covered before. This isn't some evenly split spectrum with a wide, open-minded middle that might be swayed on an argument or cause depending on how well you did.

Destiny thinks, and has often said, that the main drive behind the dogmatic Pro-Palestinian tiktok, twitter and campus hordes is 'America bad' - they start from the conclusion that 'America bad', Israel is touted as the closest and most sheltered American ally, and so they work down from there. He's wrong - the main factor fueling younger and particularly college attending demographics in their pro-Palestinian zealotry is much simpler than that, it is the thing which college kids and youngsters crave the most..... **Popularity.**

It's the numbers, stupid. Being Anti-Israeli is *inherently* more popular than being Pro-Israeli, because you've got **1.8 billion Muslims**  and **Hundreds of millions of Arabs** who are, with 99.9% consistency - fanatically, dogmatically and irrevocably 'bought in' to worshipping the concept of 'Palestine' even more than they do Muhammed at this point. It's essentially part of the faith, if not a completely new one. The countless swarms of users with a certain identity typing  in broken English 'FUK ISREAL, FREE PALESTINE, PALESTINE BEST ISREAL FAKE' and then ignoring everything you tell them have not arrived at their ideology through facts and logic, they were born into it. In most of the countries they control they even made talking to an Israeli a thought crime ( Not a joke ). 

Now add to that the tens of millions of Nazis and borderline Nazis and their ulterior motives of 'owning the Jews', their position isn't malleable either. They don't care about the subject, they just want to be on the opposite side of Jews, and their 'intellectual' leaders make no secret of it in their own communities.

It's all just pure identity politics, and in order to counter all of that, you need a base which is equally 'bought in' on the Israeli side, and for that you have.......a couple of millions of Jews ( A bunch are completely secular or barely identify as such so they got siphoned to the opposite team, we'll get to that later ) - **Not good.** Not looking good at all in fact, your odds here are analogous to that of a single dude facing a 200-strong zerg rush. In fact, if that was everything, the Pro-Israeli side would be in a much, much more dire spot at the moment, if it wasn't for the bulwark of Evangelical Christians ( 619 million ) which has arguably been the sole balancing force in Israel's favor since its inception and the reason for Pro-Palestinians crying about their propaganda not *completely* dominating every single forum. 

But guess what, they're all either old or young and culturally detached now, whereas Muslim demographics are younger and on average more radicalized, and the remaining old traditionalist Christians from the former category *don't really use the internet*. Which means you *are* fucked. 

So how do we get from here to the woke, white, atheist western zoomers stanning Hamas, the Houthis and Bin Laden and chanting death to Israel all over your Twitter Feed and campus? They want to be hip, popular, and socially accepted. They now have two choices:

1. Get screamed at, ostraczied and told to sit their white ass down and shut up by the countless Arab and Muslim students they personally know in Europe or a multicultural American city after siding with Israel, or alternatively have every single Tiktokt, Instagram or Twitter post they ever make automatically downvoted and shamed to oblivion by 1.8 billion angry Muslims online if they live anywhere else

2. Piss off that one non-timid, not self-flagellating Jewish person they know from somewhere and their conservative evangelical uncle or dad who they hate anyway

And let me tell you, choices are definitely being made. Permanent choices, because ignoring any contradiction or flaw in your newfound cult while doing adhoms over and over again is much, much preferable to losing your popularity. Your 'optics' battle was lost before it even began, and not even the greatest debate since the time of Ancient Greece is going to change that.

Middle East politics have never been a huge draw of interest for me, so I will be the first to admit I do not know much about Israel/Palestine or the dynamics of the Middle East overall. My interests are far more in Euro-American & Arctic history and the history of science and technology.

However when something kicks off that becomes a big story, I try to dig around and at least get a 101 understanding.

But this is seemingly impossible with Israel/Palestine, at least impossible to get a straight answer.

I listen to lots of different commentators with lots of different ideologies and I have seen over the last few months people who I relatively trust to not spew talking points, spew complete and total opposite talking points that contradict each other.

I will listen to one decently intelligent commentator/academic give their take, and the following video someone else who is equally intelligent will give a completely opposite take.

The bias just seems utterly inescapable. To make it even more frustrating, whenever there is a ""debate"" between two people with a disagreement it seemingly cannot even get off the ground because the participating parties cannot even agree on the basic fundamentals of the historical framework to place the parameters of the debate inside of.

Every debate basically goes like this:

**Person 1: Israelis \[OR\] Palestinians did X bad thing.**

**Person 2: Well, that's because Israelis \[OR\] Palestinians did Y bad thing!**

**Person 1: WELLLL THATS ONLY BECAUSE Israelis \[OR\] Palestinians DID Z BAAAAD THIIIING**

**Person 2: I FUNDAMENTALLY REJECT THE PREMISE OF YOUR ARGUMENT BECAUSE YOU'RE IGNORING THE FACT THAT Israelis \[OR\] Palestinians DID C & D**

**Both: REEEEEE**

Like, its insane. I have a masters in Political Science, which makes me a douchebag yes, but it also has given me enough of a nose to sniff out bias and its all I smell, from either side with this. It does not seem like anyone can shoot straight. What is crazy to me is people who shoot straight on almost all other issues just seem to have their brains turn off when it comes to this.

Like, lets look at the 2008 financial crisis as a counter-example of this frustration. Most people, liberal or conservative, old or young, left or right, establishment or anti establishment, American or non American, jewish or Muslim... most people all sort of agree on the basic fundamentals: *Wall Street got reckless with the financialization of the housing market, basically created a house of cards that came crashing down and the bailout was in hindsight suboptimal for the working and middle class.*

From there, you can and will have lots of debate between opposing biases, but again, most people will be like ""yeah that's short and sweet of it""

That type of basic fundamentals is just utterly non-existent with this discussion.

And given that I know I don't know enough about Israel-Palestine to dig my feet into a position, I feel like I never will because I don't even know how to learn about it without being blasted with the same two, diametrically opposed sets of talking points.

Anyone else feel the same way? I never took classes on middle east politics or really looked into Israel/Palestine before Oct. 7th so I truly was going in with a ""I wonder why this is"" blank slate and I feel like giving up on it.

Given this, even if a two-state ""solution"" were imposed, Palestinian grievances with Israel would continue unabated. 

The nature of Israel as a Jewish supremacist state that seeks to expand Jewish settlement would also continue to bring Israel into conflict with its remaining Arab neighbors. What worked with the Palestinians would be used against the Jordanians, then the Lebanese, then any Arab neighbor whose lands or resources Zionists claimed is rightfully part of ancient Israel by some interpretation, or by some ""practical"" claim about security needs to control water rights or strategic points.  

The only long term solution is a rejection of Zionism and Jewish supremacy in favor of one, democratic, multi-ethnic, and equal state. 

Such would not result in genocide as the Islamophobes allege, as can be seen in the very direct analogy of South Africa. The longest running and most popular resistance movement against Israel, the PLO, was calling for a secular multi-ethnic state 50 years ago. 

Equal rights also doesn't mean Arab supremacy just because they would be a majority.

1- commit acts of terrorism against their population

2- illicit a strong military response 

3- produces civilian casualties to gain sympathy 

4- frame your position in a way that leftists around the world would understand, in the 50s say it’s class struggle and fight against imperialism, in 2022 say it’s decolonization.

Repeat this until the point, that the colonizers feel it’s not worth it and withdraw. It worked in Algeria, Vietnam, …

There is one small problem though, it will NEVER work in Israel because they got nowhere to go.

Now you have multiple headlines that are definitely not Not the Onion worthy headlines and it’s pretty clear there’s been a significant mod takeover. I first noticed this when this headline : 

‘Doctor is warned after telling patients to eat less and move more’ popped up. At first the majority of comments were in agreement that the warning , regardless of sensitivity and insensitivity given the context of the article, was absurd. 

  
Then suddenly the weird reaction with and defensive crowd sprung up, claiming they read the article and the warning was fair. Having read the same article, no it isn’t. I was simply annoyed by the logical leaps and fallacies being presented by the ‘Eat less move more advice is wrong and doesn’t help countless people ( countless meaning like 20,000 out of a population of millions of overweight people) and decided to respond.

 The first couple of mins I got multiple upvotes. Checking again an hour later , it was at -2 downvotes lmao. I was like, that’s alright it’s not a big deal and it is a major loser thing to fret over anonymous accounts just downvoting you because they don’t have any real counter-response maybe? Idk. 

But I feel like it was a big sign in the downward slope of the entire sub. Normal centrist comments are being downvoted to hell, the shitlib justification of “ you fascist right winger scum” has been thrown around and the appeals to emotion fallacy is king.

bzr,174k9yr,664,,r/TrueUnpopularOpinion,"So in the Gaza/Israel conflict currently there’s talk of trading Palestinian prisoners for women and children abducted and being kept as hostages in the Gaza Strip. Now if this was just coming from Palestine who believe in traditional gender roles that would be understandable - but it’s also coming from Israel who believe in gender equality and women literally have to do military service who are advocating for the women (who are grouped with children) to be released before the men.

On top of that Western media (even left leaning feminist papers like The Guardian) are full of reports detailing “women and children” being held, or lines like “Hamas abducted an unknown amount of Israelis, among them women and children” - implying that women belong with children in a special group together more needing and deserving of protection than men. And this is coming from media outlets that are leading the charge on so called gender equality and usually all about how capable and strong women are.

Then you look at the Ukraine - men conscripted, women not. Nobody batts an eye. And why? Because the reality is they expect the men to be more effective fighters and are also more comfortable with the idea of their deaths.

So what does it all mean? Basically that our western societies have built up a level of comfort that makes it possible to play make believe gender equality and even pretend that women serving in the forces makes a difference or amounts to real equality - when in reality we’re just playing make believe because it makes feminist types feel good to live in that delusion. But the second that any shit really hits the fan everyone (including the feminist types) stops giving a crap about gender equality or the strength of women and will cry out about women and children and women become a special class more deserving of protection and sympathy once more.

Basically gender equality is a fantasy created in a prosperous society but quickly abandoned by women the second it’s no longer beneficial - but everyone is afraid to say it.",2023-10-10 13:45:47,Israel/Palestine attacks and The Ukraine war shows that gender equality is a farce and no one really wants it,0.83,888,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueUnpopularOpinion/comments/174k9yr/israelpalestine_attacks_and_the_ukraine_war_shows/

All passengers were said to have survived, managing to swim to shore and build a fire with help from locals. As the fire was lit, St Paul was bitten by a ‘venomous snake’ and the locals expected him to die, thinking he was a criminal. However he survived, astonishing the locals who began to view him as a special, or holy, person. This is considered one of his ‘miracles’ on Malta which have become the cornerstone of Maltese Christian identity, with cities, islands, churches, and streets names after St Paul all over Malta.

I was leaving the complex to walk my dog when I spotted a driver who had stopped and was staring at me. I thought nothing of it, kept walking as he drove away slowly and carried on getting off the property and to the park. Well, I get to the street, and sure enough the same car is sitting there, we make eye contact, he stares for a couple more seconds and drives away. By this point my guards are up, the way he looked me up and down sent chills up my spine. I keep walking down the street, main goal being to get inside the semi-busy park and surround myself with people, when sure enough this same car turns the corner back onto the street I'm walking down and I notice he begins to slow down. As soon as I saw him I thought, grab your phone and pretend you have a call. So I'm walking down the street, talking to myself and he drives by very slow and gives me that look again. Once he passed and I saw him turn back into my complex I hauled ass to the park where I stopped to gather my thoughts, and this is where Mitch came over. 

He came up to me, we did our usual hello's and he paused for a moment before he said ""I don't mean to intrude, but I noticed while you were walking, you kept looking over your shoulder a lot. Are you ok?"" At that moment I didn't know if I told him what was happening if he would think I was overreacting, or if he would understand why I felt scared. I explained what was happening, and without even batting an eye he said ""My pup and I would like to continue our walk with you, if you feel comfortable with that?"". Of course I said yes, and we carried on through the park. I felt my shoulders relax and knew I was safe. 

Once we got to the point where my walk would end he said ""Would you like me to walk you to your building (the farthest away) just to make sure everything is ok?"" My response was, nah I think I'm ok, what are the odds of him sticking around ... 2 seconds later, he pulls out of the complex again, and gives me the creepy stare before he drives off. At that point, without hesitation Mitch says ""Let's carry on"". As we are walking he so calmly says to me ""If I see that car again, I am going to gently take your hand in mine as if we are a couple, as long as you are ok with that? And if so I need you to do two things. Nod in agreement, and move your leash to your other hand so your hand closest to me is available"". I didn't have to think twice, I nodded as I moved the leash and we continued to walk and carry on conversation like nothing had happened. 

I got to my building's main entrance safely, and I didn't know what to say. I couldn't thank this man enough for being so protective of me, a woman he had only had a few interactions with here and there. It was then he took a few minutes to explain his background, and it made a lot more sense. He was an ex-Israeli soldier who left Israel when his Mom was constantly being abused by his Father and no one would help. He used all his money to move his Mom, little sister and their family dog to a safe place far away from his Father until he could join them. He said it was at that point, he decided he would do everything in his power to ensure women felt safe and secure, no matter the circumstances. 

I learned a lot tonight, and I feel like if it weren't for Mitch, something bad could have happened. I appreciated his soft, consensual approach to me, especially when he could see I was struggling and stressed. The world needs more men like Mitch.





***UPDATE: Firstly, OMG you guys. I have never felt soooo loved and heard from a group of strangers. Honestly you guys made my day. Waking up and seeing all of your responses, I couldn't help but cry. You are all an amazing group of humans and thank you again for the support 🩷

I went and filed a police report after work, with as much detail as I had, model of the car, colour, description of the guy. Sadly my brain went into panic mode and I did not get the license plate. I also notified the condo management company and they in turn have advised our security to be on the lookout. Again thank you everyone for all of your suggestions, and words of encouragement. 

Secondly, some of you are both hilarious and have very twisted minds lol. Trust me, this was not some creepy set up by Mitch. His reactions to me were very genuine, and I could not be more grateful for him and everything he did. 

Lastly, for those who are saying my title was mean or that I didn't appreciate Mitch by referring to the ""annoying neighbour"". I think I made it very clear that I DO NOT see him that way at all, and I am extremely, EXTREMELY grateful for his help last night. I cried when I got home before I posted this because I was so overwhelmed with his kindness and support. I kept asking him how I could pay him back, but he said there was no need. Just to stay safe, and come find him if I ever need his help. I'm sorry that out of my entire post, all you could focus on was the title. That really was not the point of me sharing.

Oh and really lastly lol I don't know if he's married/single/in a relationship 😂 he didn't mention this while we were walking and talking. Maybe I'll ask for a friend 😉",2023-07-04 05:29:37,"Today, I could not have been more thankful to run into that ""annoying neighbour""",0.97,10375,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/14q4ska/today_i_could_not_have_been_more_thankful_to_run/

,1buvx23,2360,,r/thedavidpakmanshow,"I’ve been reflecting on how my political perspective has shifted dramatically over the last decade. In my early 20s, life felt manageable despite its ups and downs, partly because I believed that, at the end of the day, we’d all be okay. My political leanings were conservative, but not in the way we might define it today; I was what you might call “socially liberal, fiscally conservative,” believing in the separation of my religious views from politics.

My voting history reflects my evolving beliefs. In 2008, I cast my first vote for Obama, hopeful for change. But by 2012, disillusioned by his drone program and the 2011 NDAA, I sought change in Ron Paul. 

In 2016, I was filled with hope as it seemed the GOP shifted left. For the first time, a pro-lgbt, pro-choice, and non interventionist candidate rose to acquire the nomination. He even vowed to protect our lgbtq citizens. His fans cheered and he praised the crowd for having grown to love our lgbtq community. He said he was “very pro choice” and would always protect a woman’s right to choose. I never heard any republican say stuff like this before and make it to the top. If this is the worst possible candidate like all of the democrats say, then we’re doing pretty well!

That candidate was Donald Trump. 

Even in 2020 after RBG died, he dismissed the idea that he would dismantle abortion rights and lgbtq rights. 

Where are we now? 

I thought Trump would be the same or better on many issues and I could punish democrats electorally to achieve the policies I wanted. I have not been successful. Granted I’m not saying we should have blind loyalty to Biden. I, myself, am an uncommitted voter. What I wanted has not happened and my choices suck.

I can gain a hundredth of a centimeter or lose hundreds of yards. 

I was mad at Hilary and Obama’s drone program. Trumps was significantly worse.

I was angry at the dems for their stances on privacy laws and habeus corpus. We now have a political party running on removing term limits and suspending the constitution.

My criticism of democrats still stands, but I know what the other side presents in contrast.

I remember being lectured as someone who didn’t back Hilary in 2016 and I look back at my lecturers as having wisdom I simply didn’t possess. Many of them were in their 40s and watched what happened in the early 2000s and how it led directly to where we are now.

I’m saddened by the lack of memory we have with the last 8 years. It saddens me to hear someone say “well if Trump wins, at least it’ll be only 4 years.” Or maybe if we make the democrats lose, they’ll change their policies. All this after January 6th. After the right explicitly says they’ll undo the democratic process and outlines, in writing, how they’ll do it.

Things are tangibly worse. They were not perfect before, but things were better. It will take a generation or more to undo what the radical right has done, but every step not taken forward allows us to be pushed back miles.

What’s happening in Palestine is not right. I have Jewish family and was raised strictly Zionist. It’s not right, but liberal Zionist Jews have always had an unhealthy alliance with evangelicals. I’ve heard what they believe. A lot of evangelicals view Israel as a key eschatological milestone. Remove the Muslims, put all the Jews back in (Greater) Israel, and we’ll have heaven on earth. They literally believe this. The extermination of Palestinians brings them a step closer to their prized rapture.

Which candidate are they backing in 2024?

I’ll close with a quote I now understand more than ever. I first heard it in 2009, but didn’t understand it full until this year.

“Benign idealism leads only to nurture evil.”

Just as Hamas seems to have overplayed its cynical hand with this round of attacks and PR warring, many on the far left seem to have finally said the quiet part out loud and evinced a worldview every bit as ugly as the fascists they claim to oppose. This piece explores what has unfolded on the ground and online in recent days.

,141gg0x,179,,r/nbacirclejerk,"Lebron James - The easy joke here is that you are somebody who doesn’t really know anything about basketball and just picked the guy you recognised from Space Jam or adverts, but the truth runs a little bit deeper than that. If Lebron James is your favourite player you don’t even like basketball, you like arguing online. The sad truth is, you desperately crave the facade of friendship that comes with the tribalism inherent to picking a side in a popular argument. You exist only to say Lebron is better than Jordan or Curry or Dwyane Wade or whoever it is you and your gang are arguing about that week. Any game of basketball that doesn’t have Lebron in it is completely worthless to you unless it can be used as evidence about a player that Lebron played with/against. Any game with Lebron in it is a nightmare, because you know if he plays badly MJ fans will make fun of you on Twitter, and to you that’s all that matters.

Steph Curry - To be a Curry fan means that, intrinsically, you are spoiled. Your hands are soft and unworked, your mummy still pays for your groceries and you have a manservant to wipe your ass when you’ve finished shitting. You were raised on state-funded winning and excuses for failure. You would never survive even a day in the wild, you shrink from adversity like a child fleeing the hand of an abusive father and you speak like a ten-year old. You have no place in the dirtier arguments of the NBA, you consider yourself above them. Steph and his superteam have coddled you, made you feeble with his asterisk rings. The thought of supporting a REAL player, somebody you have to FIGHT for scares you too much. You are, and forever will be, bitchmade. 

Kawhi Leonard - You will never understand why the rest of us are so jealous of you. Kawhi has his rings, he has his fan love and he has an excuse to retire early and not embarrass you with the sight of having to watch him average 7 points a game for the Grizzlies at the age of 36. You support a basketball player who isn’t. Kawhi is now little more than a myth, a legend of the rings of yesteryear that echoes throughout the barren planes of San Antonio and Toronto. All you, as his trusted liege can do is keep the flame alive for as long as you can. The winds may howl and call him a pussy for his load management but as long as you shelter the flame, and Kawhi keeps conveniently getting injured when the Clippers need him, you will be safe. They will always remember the Philly shot. That’s all you need. 

Joel Embiid - He can’t keep getting away with this, right? I mean, you put in WORK to get him that MVP, more work than he did, and this is how he repays you? You remember a time when you laughed at the fans of ringless players. AI, Melo, Lillard, Chris Paul, Harden until he saw the light, all bums. Embiid would get you a ring, he was designed to get you a ring, he had to get you a ring. You deserve a ring. You sat through the rebuild, all those injury problems, Ben fucking Simmons, all because you were promised a ring. And every year you would say ‘we lost because of this thing that isn’t Embiid’s fault, we’ll be back next year!’. And for a while, the public believed you. They bought your tales and your lies. Not anymore. They know the truth now, and they hate him for it. Deep down, you do too. 

Kevin Durant - How many times will KD ‘seek a new challenge’ or ‘make the move right for him’ before you come to terms with what he is? He’s a nasty ring chaser, and that’s okay. Everyone would respect you more if you just admitted it. You can cope all you want and justify all his moves by claiming ‘toxic environment!’ or ‘the front office hated him!’ but even you don’t believe that, you just say it to save face. The worst part is, you haven’t heard the worst of it yet. KD has gone remarkably unscrutinized by NBA media as a whole, but when people start to question whether the most remarkable unicorn the NBA had seen since Wemby should have more than two state-funded rings, you might have some explaining to do. Maybe he should have stayed loyal to Oakland. Not OKC though, fuck that place. 

James Harden - I want you to find a coin right now and flip it, catch it in your hand and turn it over. Take note of what side it lands on and keep flipping it until it lands on the other side. If you can flip this coin 56 times and have it land on the same side every time, congratulations! You have matched the statistical probability of the 2018 Rockets missing 27 consecutive threes. What this exercise should show you is that God is real and for whatever reason, he hates James Harden. Spare your soul and support a real player instead.

Giannis Antetokounmpo - Nobody has ever enjoyed a Giannis performance without already being a fan of Giannis in the first place. He is perhaps the most consistently boring superstar to watch. He never takes threes unless they’re wide open, he has never had a super interesting or acrobatic dunk, he loves free throws and he makes about 14 barely contested layups per game. He has no dribbling bag and his defence relies on simply being large. He is a boring player, and you know this, because that’s why you like him. Your idea of ‘good basketball’ is simply the person who can score the most points with the highest efficiency. You live and die by the box score because you genuinely think that’s the objective way of saying who had the best game. You could be sat in front of an Excel spreadsheet instead of a Bucks game and have essentially the same amount of fun, because your brain has been programmed to release dopamine whenever it sees three numbers over 10 next to each other. You are boring, we all think you’re dull, and when the rest of us are discussing real basketball we don’t want you anywhere near us because your idea of humour is just saying the jokes that Giannis said again. An Allen Iverson comp would kill you on the spot. 

Russell Westbrook - It would be easy to make a joke about how much you miss 2017 and how you pretended it still is to try and stop the pain from setting in, but to be honest I honestly think you do still genuinely believe it to be 2017. For you, time hasn’t progressed at all. You’ve been known to play Despacito and Ed Sheeran when you get the aux and you can’t stop talking about how excited you are for Infinity War to come out. And yes, you do still somehow believe Russell Westbrook is a good player. Despite all your friends and family pleading with you to move on and showing you Youtube videos of that time he hit the side of the backboard, you firmly believe that Russ is still cooking on the Thunder. I can promise you, it doesn’t get better. Wake up now before we lose you forever. 

Nikola Jokic. You are a 35 year old white guy with a beard and glasses who would, if asked to, happily pay to get advanced basketball statistics. Your life is filled with words like ‘True Shooting’ and ‘Player Impact Estimate’ that the rest of us couldn’t give a single shit about. You are who KD was talking about when he said people watch basketball through a graph. If I showed you a powerpoint saying that Mike Conley is the piece missing from the Suns to make them chip favourites you would believe me as long as I added in enough bar graphs. You have a poster of Ernie on your wall. You have never discussed basketball without double checking a fact on your phone. When you go to a bar in a city you don’t know you make a big deal about ordering local beers, and if the guy next to you didn’t hear you order it you order it again but louder. You have strong opinions on pirating that nobody agrees with. You are probably a centrist. You have no idea how much I pity you. 

Luka Doncic - There are two types of Luka fans, the hollow, soulless Mavs fan who physically cannot talk about his team without saying the phrase ‘We just need to get Luka some help’, and the 16 year old jerker who’s brain instinctively goes ‘Luka Doncic is Devin Booker father’ the second they see his name. Both are equally hard to talk to, but at least the Mavs fan has an excuse for their suicidal demeanour. The jerker is barely even a human at this point, a bag of flesh that surrounds an endless stream of catchphrases and recycled memes. Luka Doncic is Devin Booker father. If you laughed at that for the second time, seek therapy or employment. 

Jayson Tatum - Bro I am NOT GAY, I promise but IF I was, IF bro, IF I was then of course I would have sweaty man sex with Jayson Tatum, he’s just cute bro it’s not gay to say that bro it isn’t I swear. What? Tatum’s game isn’t good enough to justify the lengths I’ll go to defend him? He’s not really all that and I only love him so much because I think he’s sexually attractive. Nah bro you’re crazy for that one I won’t lie, just because Tatum’s lips are soft like pillows and I like the way his ass jiggles and I wish the NBA would let him play without a shirt on doesn’t make me gay bro you’re crazy for that one. 

Zion Williamson - The Great Zion Debate revolves around a single word; ‘if’. IF Zion was to play regularly, he’d probably be top 3 bigs in the league, but guess what? He doesn’t, so he isn't. That should be a very simple thing to understand, but Zion fans love nothing more than to drag everyone into a world full of hypotheticals and make-believe, where anything is possible except Zion’s shitty conditioning being his own fault. Eventually you’ll be spat out of their portal wearing nothing but a lobster bib and a Jose Alvarado jersey, fully believing that it’s AD’s fault that Zion loves food more than he loves his own mother. After all, you can’t say he plays bad if he simply never plays.

Damian Lillard - Oh fuck you’re so cool man, you’re so cool because the player you support is so loyal man, that just makes you so much cooler than everyone else man. Ignore all the times you’ve screamed for him to be traded because the Trail Blazers are a complete poverty franchise, that doesn’t matter because Dame is so loyal and cool man, Dame time baby let’s go! Let’s fucking go! Who cares that the current state of the NBA would be exactly the same if Dame was never drafted and spent his entire life delivering DnD equipment to Portland’s extensive collective of people who couldn’t care less about basketball, he’s so clutch! Ignore all the red flags and hope the Lakers come through with a trade request. You’ll need post-season success more than you think in the years to come. 

Chris Paul - When Chris Paul retires without a ring, which is a near guarantee unless Phoenix fix their shit or he begs Denver to take his dog ass for a season, what will you do? You probably gave up on your hopes of a ring around the same time Harden fans did, but man 2021 gave you hope didn’t it? Just for a second you felt what it was like to support a real player, a real man. Not the banana boat enthusiast who choked leads like they were Bart Simpson, but a player who could maybe win something someday. It must have been nice while it lasted. Then, reality set in. To be honest, I don’t really know who I’m talking to with this one. Chris Paul surely doesn’t have any fans left. He barely even has his own family on his side. Ah well, you’ll always have Lob City. And Kim K. 

Jimmy Butler - It’s always someone else’s fault isn’t it. Ever since Jimmy realised he could just blame KAT for all the T’wolves failings you’ve carried on that legacy for as long as you can remember. Maybe if Bam plays better against Denver your beloved Jordan surrogate won’t have to be directly outscored by UDFA’s every night. It’s okay though, Jimmy has ‘fundamentals’. You love fundamentals don’t you, they’re that thing you use when you don’t have any actual arguments to say why Jimmy’s better than the perennial MVP candidate you’ve set him up against for no reason. You can whine and cope and say ‘he makes his teammates better’ but if that were true, wouldn’t he have achieved something in Chicago, or with that very promising Minnesota roster? Surely it must be someone else’s fault. Maybe it’s the leagues for hiring referees. Or maybe it’s KAT’s fault again. Who knows.

Kyrie Irving - Kyrie fans are the rare breed of basketball fan that actually play basketball, the problem is that they think they’re him with the handles and the ankle breakers and the and-ones, but in reality they are complete fucking garbage. I will never choose you to play pickup with unless you are the last option and I will never pass you the ball because I don’t want to watch you bounce it off your own thigh for 20 minutes. And dude, can you please stop talking about the Zionist New World Order or whatever the fuck you saw on Twitter last night? I fucking doubt the guy with the MAGA Pepe pfp has links deep in the US government, so forgive me for not believing that they put aphrodisiacs in the tap water so that we spend all our money on babies, just help me guard their sharpshooter or fuck off. And wear some deodorant fucking hell. 

Devin Booker - You know, if a player needs All-Star candidates at every other position on the court just to progress to the Conference Finals, chances are that player isn’t very good. This thought does not register in the mind of the Booker fan, who genuinely believes that KD, Chris Paul and Deandre Ayton isn’t enough help. Your greed knows no bounds and will swallow you whole one day, yet in your lust for power you fail to turn inwards. Where was Booker vs the Mavs that one time? Why did he only score 12 points vs the Nuggets this year? Is he stupid? Does he not know he can play well in big games? No, no, clearly the Suns just need to trade Cam Payne and Ayton for Sabonis or AD or some other top 5 big, surely that’s where the problem lies right? Wait, what do you mean salary cap? 

Ja Morant - Oh man I feel bad for you. You’re probably a guy who just enjoys basketball as a spectacle, who doesn’t particularly care about winning or losing as long as you get to watch the most entertaining players in the league pull off the most ridiculously flashy plays. Isn’t that what we all want, deep down? Maybe you were raised on a healthy diet of Vince Carter or D Rose, maybe you just think a guy who can jump over another guy for a bucket is neat, whatever the answer is you’re trapped with this fucking idiot who can’t keep himself out of trouble. Now the team you touted as the most exciting in the league is the most hated in the league, and through no fault of your own you look like a fucking idiot. Worse still, the sheen has come off the Grizzlies young core and now people actually expect them to start winning, probably without Ja. Consider suing Instagram before Adam Silver demands Ja be burned at the stake for his transgressions against his fellow players. 

Trae Young - Yes, we all remember that New York series. Yes, we all thought Ice Trae was hot shit at the time. But guess what? That was 2 years ago and Trae has shown no signs of progressions since. Still a liability on defence, still a massive ball hog and still ugly as fuck. Just face the facts and admit that without these rivalries you create, be it with New York or Luka or whoever, Trae would be the most forgettable player in the league. Three point specialists are a dime a dozen in the post-Steph era, and there’s nothing to really separate your fave from Dame or Paul George or De’Aaron Fox or any other number of downtown dwellers.

Written in 1917, Balfour's declaration began the ethnic cleansing of Palestine by promising the land away which the British never had the right to do. After the Declaration, until 1948, the British burnt down indigenous villages to prepare the way; with this came arbitrary killings, arrests, torture and sexual violence including rape.
The British paved the way for the Nakba and trained the Zionist militia to ethnically cleanse over 750,000 Palestinians, destroy over 500 villages and massacre many families. The Nakba never stopped and the genocide today is rooted and supported by British complicity. Now, Elbit Systems, Israel's biggest weapons manufacturer use Britain as a manufacturing outpost to build arms which are ""battle-tested"" on Palestinians.""

But Ethan posting and entire thread of horrible things that happened to them followed by a post that basically just says “and what’s happening in Gaza is also horrible” to talk about war crimes and a literal ethnic cleansing is just so so so tone deaf. 

And I understand that Ethan feels more connected to the Israelis because he lived there, but I think he should take a step back and really think he needs to take a step back and think about how he’d view what’s going on if he had no ties to Israel. Honestly,  i don’t even think he’d be this defensive if it were America doing the same things as Israel. 

I don’t think Ethan is apathetic to Palestinian suffering, but I feel like he really just cannot see this clearly and objectively

Ethan, if you see this. I’m a fan, I know you’re not trying to be cruel. I Just think you should take a step back. Pls don’t post this to your story. This isn’t a hate post. Just food for though. 

Edit: don’t love that he was reading my post when talking about how people are accusing him of supporting the IDF, that he’s a Zionist or that we ‘shouldn’t talk about’ the Israeli victims. I never said or implied any of that. I don’t think that. But he was inserting other things he’s seen on the sub into what he thinks my thoughts are. I was just pointing out how he went into depth and detail of what Israel went through and at the same time summed up what’s happening in Gaza in two sentences, when the gravity of what’s happening in Gaza is in such an insanely bigger scale. Fan since 2018, still a fan. Just wish he read what MY post said, and what I was saying rather than equating it to others.

,17g2ueg,556,,r/Destiny,"The online left seems to have a very American centric view of the current conflict and it seems like they don't seem to understand or even care what the reality is for many Jewish people and people with Jewish roots in Europe. In Muslim majority neighbourhoods in most big cities across western Europe it has not been safe to be openly Jewish, meaning wearing any visual indicators like a yarmulke or a star of David on a chain for years. Whenever this conflict in Israel-Palestine heats up, it becomes outright dangerous, to even go to a Jewish school or Synagoge, many cities will have armed police and surveillance units stationed near these places 24/7. The far right used to talk about ""no go zones"", but spun it as if being white was dangerous but sadly this has been the reality for Jews for a very long time. 

I have a Jewish grandfather myself, the only survivor of his family in the Holocaust, when he was alive he ingrained it into my mom and my aunt and later in me and my siblings to NEVER tell anyone we were Jewish. He completely assimilated into Christianity to protect his family, which post ww2 is understandable but when looking at the chants during protests recently, his words echo in my head a lot these days and I get paranoid to maybe have told the wrong person about my being Jewish and having a sister in Israel. Generational trauma is also a real thing, many Jews in Europe are super on edge right now, many of them traditionally progressive left wing/labour and pro Palestinian. 

During times like these many of us feel isolated like tiny islands stuck between two sides that are equally damaging, the side that wants Gaza glassed and the side that wants to see every Israeli/Jew wiped from the earth and driven ""from the river into the sea"". Many of us would tick all the right boxes for the left but right now we either have to betray our own identity and join the chants for our eradication or pretend we are not Jewish to not get into discussions that have nothing to do with us.

The media then portrays the Muslim minority as being afraid and let's be fair, they might be, but that same minority has created an unsafe environment for Jews in western Europe that is becoming more and more unsafe. I had left wing people call my sister a Nazi for simply being a Israeli citizen, her kids I suppose are Hitler Jugend to them. It is disgusting how the online left treats this, the attacks on Ethan Klein, him being called privileged for not wanting to discuss it anymore, attacks on Eristocracy for telling how this affects her and speaking from the heart, it doesn't matter how pro Palestine we say we are, in the end we are just dirty ""Zionists"" because we want our family to be safe.

Thankfully, in retrospect, we could barely eat day to day, so my mother was never complicit by traveling to Israel. Our only exposure to Jews were the stories in the Bible. However, the first time I learned about the Israel/ Palestinian story, I knew in my gut that it was a great injustice. It just never made any sense. If I believed in equality of all people, I clearly could not support an ethno-religious state. I always saw the Palestinians as a group of people fked over by history. And one day, when I was long dead the world would finally come to realize the evil done to them. I just put it in the back of my mind and moved on. 

Then when October 7th happened, suddenly this thing was in the news and couldn't be avoided. Then I felt like the whole fkn world was gaslighting me as every single western nation gave Israel Carte Blanche to kill as many Palestinians as they wanted and major celebs were voicing approval of the bombing campaign. Then the idea that anyone who didn't support the slaughter was an antisemite became the talking point de jour. I felt like I was taking crazy pills. But my gut that told me as a young girl that th3 Palestinians were oppressed would not go away. And though I pride myself for being what I call a radical egalitarian, I have to live with the fact that saying the TRUTH means I can and will be labeled an antisemite.

politics,1764vdf,248,,r/atheism,"So I argued with my Dad about abortion today, and he disagreed with my pro-choice stance and arguments. Instead of giving arguments back (like you are meant to in a debate), he resulted in rants about how leftists and atheists are blind for not believing in God. He talked about how Atheists want to be atheist to ""avoid feeling bad for pushing the gay rights, feminist and trans agenda"", and how all leftists and atheists are just ""lazy couch potatoes who want no responsibility."" He then resulted in asking me,""Where is your evidence that there is no God,"" in which I told him that he has to provide the evidence for God. Oh yeah he is also an anti-vaxxer, a homophobe (he has talked about shooting all gays and putting them into camps on multiple occasions), and on top of all that he believes Covid was faked and that Zionist Jews run the world.

He also unironically likes to talk about how he is so smart. He should be a university professor.

I have a theory that Religious people are more likely to believe in Conspiracy Theories, because they already believe in dogmatic bullshit.

Edit1: I didn't expect so much replies, So I will just clarify some things.

Edit1-2: Thankfully, we live in a European country, where we don't have access to firearms, he is also not a pro-Trumpist, because he believes that trump is just another actor for the global elites like Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates.

Edit1-3: Me and my dad have a weird relationship. We both love each other, but he is only like this when we debate about politics, religion, and conspiracy theories(or when he is ranting about something). He is *normally* quite a nice and funny person. Usually 1-2 hours after a debate, he starts acting normal.

Edit1-4: I've noticed that my dad's homophobia and transphobia are based on some ideal perception of what is normal and is about conforming to a spectrum of values (which he considers being right and normal). He judges people for having different hair, or dressing differently than ""normal"" and talks about how they are ""retarded"" (with a sense of hatred towards them). He once mocked a priest after church for wearing pinkish sneakers.

Edit1-5: It's nice to know that my theory has scientific evidence.

Edit2: Holy crap this blew up, ok *clarifying machine go brrrrr*

Edit2-2: My Dad didn't give back *any* arguments for his ""pro-life"" (more like anti-choice) stance. He simply started calling me blind and stupid for always asking for evidence for whatever he claimed.

Edit2-3: We live in a quite religious Eastern European country.

Edit2-4: I am quite a hopeful person in this regard, and I believe that there is some combination of words that can get him to think, I've already managed to get him to agree with Socialism (by describing the concept without giving the name and asking if it is a good concept).

,1777bai,221,,r/Destiny,"When you think of the alt-right you think of anti-semitism and extreme anti-zionism and in the case of Israel the alt-right and the current far left are basically hand in hand on their takes. A lot of their takes on the economy are very similar as well like economic protectionism, hatred of corporations, and less international trade to name a few. Obviously, their social takes are vastly different but it's pretty alarming how similar their foreign policy views are becoming.  

As far as why I think rhetorically it's a better description the far left implies someone who is very progressive while the far right implies someone who is very conservative. The alt-right implies to me that the person is very conservative with alternative unhinged takes. People like Hamasanabi are very progressive when it comes to American social issues, political history, and the economy but when it is time to apply that progressive worldview to places like China, Russia/USSR, Palestine, the Middle East, etc. the consistency just falls apart and it comes across just as unhinged as the alt-right.

,17k2f5b,476,,r/conspiracy,"Do many Americans not really think about this or are they even afraid to talk about it? I find it extremely strange how important Israel is in U.S. foreign policy. I would even go so far as to claim that it's not simply a part of U.S. foreign policy, but rather the central purpose of all foreign policy actions. The USA and all Western states fund Israel to an extent that can hardly be explained by the Holocaust. Especially considering the USA wasn't even responsible for the Holocaust, and other ethnic groups don't receive this support. On the contrary, the USA, along with the Soviet Union, made the most significant contribution to combating Nazism and paid a high price to end the Holocaust. And Israel isn't even a poor country that would need support to that extent. I mean, if a small country like Israel has a better healthcare and social system than the entire USA, then one really has to question whether U.S. citizens might need that money themselves. In all UN resolutions, the USA votes in the interest of Israel, although there are dozens of legitimate criticisms of the country's actions. And all statements of U.S. foreign policy are in the interest of this small country. Even looking into history, you can see that the USA has even heavily advocated for the creation of this Jewish state. All significant positions in the USA are occupied by people who identify with Zionism. And this cannot be explained by religious conservatives who support Israel because it's in the Bible. What about the secular individuals who are also within the Democratic party? I would even argue that the support for this country goes so far that the USA completely neglects its own interests for it. When Hamas attacked Israel in October, weapons and ammunition that were originally intended for Ukraine were immediately sent to Israel. Consider how long Zelensky diplomatically fought for weapons for his country and how quickly the USA suddenly sent them to Israel. Supporting this country has actually only caused problems for the USA. None of the neighbors of this country are favorable, and this has repeatedly affected relations with them. Apparently, this one country is more important to the USA than all the relationships with the states in the Middle East. A global superpower that cares more about this small country than for its own interests. I can't find a rational explanation for that.

So the Prime minster of israel, and the rest of his extremist cabinet, just want the war to rage on, as long as they get their paychecks, and as long as the people they dislike are dying. Doesn't matter if it's at the cost of kids, elderly, pregnant women, hostages.. They just pretend to have a mission.

So let's talk about the supposed mission of ""Eliminating Hamas""

The israeli gov will claim they are only targeting Hamas..

But, for years, Netanyahu was reported to be helping fund Hamas (as per [TimesOfIsrael](https://www.timesofisrael.com/for-years-netanyahu-propped-up-hamas-now-its-blown-up-in-our-faces/) & [NyTimes](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/10/world/middleeast/israel-qatar-money-prop-up-hamas.html)), and in 2019, He himself said and i [quote](https://twitter.com/haaretzcom/status/1711329340804186619?lang=en); ""Whoever wants to thwart the establishment of a Palestinian state needs to support the strengthening and financing of Hamas.

""On top of that, The current finance minister of israel, said in 2015 and i [quote](https://twitter.com/rulajebreal/status/1720923597873549554) ""Hamas at this point, in my opinion, is an asset.""

So how can you eliminate your asset?

Here's the government strategy;

Keep Hamas in power. Offer anything except a sovereign Palestinian state ""for security reasons"", and disrupt any real effort for Peace ([Osslo accords](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/12/oslo-israel-reneged-colonial-palestine)). Ignore the illegal settlements ([condemned by the UN](https://press.un.org/en/2023/sc15424.doc.htm)), and the killing of Palestinians in the israeli controlled West bank.

Make life unbearable for Palestinians, Facilitate unemployment [conditions](https://www.btselem.org/gaza_strip/20190606_forced_unemployment), cut the water sources ([documented](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2017/11/the-occupation-of-water/)), introduce bills to control the [courts](https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-s-supreme-court-overturns-a-key-component-of-netanyahu-s-polarizing-judicial-overhaul-/7420408.html), destroying the biggest buildings in Gaza to displace civilians, killing and arresting civilians who protest or show any contempt of past actions, Hamas attacks you, literally do whatever you want (Defending yourself).

5 months after Oct the 7th, Gaza flattened, at least 30k civilians dead (most are women and children as reported by the pentagon), israel killed more hostages than released, Hamas still around.

&#x200B;

The goal was clear, even before Oct the 7th, they never wanted Peace, or a Palestinian state.

&#x200B;

2023 was reported to be the deadliest year in the history of the West bank. It got to the point where Biden himself had put a ban on individuals committing atrocities there, and that's not mentioning the uncontrolled army killings, because they see no consequences, they act as if the Palestinian lives do not matter.

&#x200B;

As cited in South Africa's [case](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOW_1exsHE8), the army led by Netanyahu believe everyone in Gaza is complicit, as Netanyahu cited the biblical term ""Amalek"" at the beginning of the offensive on Gaza, he said ""Remember what the Amalek has done to you.""

The biblical scripture regarding Amalekites reads ""I will punish the Amalekites for what they did to Israel. Now go, attack the Amalekites and totally destroy all that belongs to them. Do not spare them; put to death men and women, children and infants, cattle and sheep, camels and donkeys.

'The IDF soldiers later filmed themselves shouting ""There are no innocent civilians"". They also have filmed themselves celebrating destruction, burning aid, looting homes, posing in women's underwear, mocking traumatized people, the list goes on..

&#x200B;

Currently, famine is looming on many in Gaza, as reports confirm israel have been blocking aid to the entire north, for three month, till two days ago, when they got pressured into letting 13 trucks in, which is way short of what is needed (500 trucks per day as estimated by UN).

Earlier this week, The US Senator Chris Van Hollen admits after crafting the national security memorandum, and after the reports, that israel is not in compliance with international law, they are blocking aid such as maternity kits, water purifiers, from entering the Gaza strip, sending back a lot of the of trucks, not to mention letting civilians block aid entrances..

He also stated that, “There is no doubt that the claims that Netanyahu made that UNRWA is a tool of Hamas are ""flat-out lies,"","" The person who runs operations on the ground in Gaza is a 20 year U.S. Army veteran”, he added.

Earlier, The israeli gov claimed 12 UNRWA (Aid agency) members were affiliated with Hamas, without providing evidence, and the US cut aid to UNRWA, so did the EU, amidst famine. Now amidst investigations, there is no evidence of such affiliation, even UNRWA stated that personal were tortured to admit such links. The EU have restored funding, and the US is still pending..

&#x200B;

It has become evident that the Netanyahu's government, and those with extremist ideology (Zionism), never wanted peace in the middle east (as stated in the Likud party charter) they want all the land from Jordan to the sea, and they will abuse the power given to them without oversight

&#x200B;

As history shows, if we really want to achieve peace, we must deliver justice, prosecute criminals, and figure out democratic solutions, without malicious intent from fascist governments.

&#x200B;

And before you go,Here are my 3 main questions/concerns to be answered thoroughly for you to change my mind;

&#x200B;

1-  Why would the israeli army [bulldoze](https://twitter.com/i/status/1748013404663537974) trees in the middle of the roads, render all water treatment plants nonfunctional or [destroyed](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/17/world/middleeast/gaza-water-plant-photos.html), blocking aid trucks from entering maternity kits & water purifiers?

2- According to all humanitarian fronts ([UN](https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/03/1147656), [IRC](https://www.rescue.org/press-release/famine-imminent-northern-gaza-children-are-being-starved-israels-blockade-and), [ICP](https://www.care-international.org/news/ipc-report-half-gaza-experiencing-catastrophic-hunger-famine-imminent-northern-governorates) and more), 1 million civilians in Gaza right now are facing stage 5 of famine (the highest), why would the israeli gov still blockade the aid when they can control how it is distributed and got the armed forces to secure that?

3- Some people are yelling ""release the hostages"" on posts of dying kids (as if these kids got them), do you think it's acceptable for the isreali gov to starve kids/innocent civilians to death if Hamas can sort themselves out and not surrender?",2024-03-21 09:29:04,CMV: Netanyahu Never wanted Peace,0.71,921,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bk2irj/cmv_netanyahu_never_wanted_peace/

,1apgu49,102,,r/binchtopiapod,"I am an adamant anti-zionist Jew.I have done organizing work with various anti-zionist groups since 2016. Until I dropped out of college, I had written about half a thesis on Jewish anti-zionism. There is no excuse for what is happening in Gaza. It is not a “conflict,” it is not “complicated,” it is GENOCIDE… For Israel to use our pain and historical oppression as a justification for this is absolutely disgusting.

**And also** (nuance haters leave the chat please) 

It’s really really hard, as a Jewish American, to talk about this with your family. It is NOT the same as having racist white family members. My grandma remembers the Holocaust and her late husband grew up with no father because his mother escaped while pregnant while my great grandfather stayed behind and died in a gas chamber. My grandma is a traumatized person. She gets upset when I debate about Israel with her or other family members. Really upset. She’s 83 years old, and I love her a lot, so I don’t do it. It’s not worth it. Ashkenazi Jews are assimilated (in the US), but my grandma did not grow up in a world that treated her as “white.” I don’t agree with her but if I had a public platform the way Julia does, I would feel really conflicted. I know for a fact that a rift between my family and I would come up, in a way that, in some cases, couldn’t be fully repaired. Julia’s dad is a professor of Jewish studies… It seems dicey, and honestly, I feel for her. I think it’s her right to decide what she wants to say about it, if anything.  This show is not going to solve the genocide in Gaza. It’s a lighthearted podcast with a niche audience.

Criticizing Israel/zionism is NOT antisemitic, and although I think *some* anti-zionists also do antisemitic things, I actually don’t really see very much of it in anti-zionist spaces! That said, probably the most typical antisemitic behavior that I personally (occasionally) experience from anti-zionist leftists is someone learning that I’m Jewish and then GRILLING me about Israel. I don’t have family in Israel. I’ve personally never been there. It makes me really uncomfortable and paranoid, it kind of makes me feel dirty and less than. 

The nuanced reality is that although the majority of young American Jews are critical of Israel, many of us have NUANCED **interpersonal** issues to work through in our families and communities. Julia is a content creator who makes a funny silly show for sad gays to use as a friendship simulator. I mainly listen when I am falling asleep. This podcast is simply not that deep. The situation in Gaza is horrifying and honestly, I don’t think it would be a very fun topic. This isn’t a news show. People don’t owe you every single opinion they have on the atrocities of the world. And frankly, I don’t think everyone would be making such a big deal about it if one of the hosts wasn’t Jewish and had previously had honest discussions on the show about antisemitism.

There was one Rabbi leading our group, and he also happened to be the only Jewish staff member present.

When he mentioned the fact that antisemitism, as we all know, has become pervasive as a result of the conflict in the Middle-East, all hell broke loose.

Immediately, the people next to me starting whispering that he was being purposely provocative, and questioned why they should care about the Shoah, because evidently, Jewish people don't care about Palestinians. Just to remind you, we were standing in *literal* Auschwitz while this took place. Later, I heard somebody say, while we were metres from the gas chambers, that if they could, they'd finish the job. 

Earlier, me and the only other Jewish participant had received dirty stares from people in our group because we had brought an Israeli flag, which might I add, is an incredibly common thing to raise at these sites. But on the plane (I went with an organised group) we heard multiple people mocking us, saying they were disgusted by the fact that we had even dared bring one. For clarity, this was my first time visiting a concentration camp, which made the experience even more awful and humiliating.

At first, I wondered if maybe I'd made the wrong decision by bringing an Israeli flag. Some of the people on this trip had never encountered Jews before, and might have had misinformed views about Zionism or what it connotates. But fuck that. Non-Jews do not, and will NEVER have the right to police how Jews behave and react in the sites of their trauma. The one place we should never feel afraid to be publicly Jewish is Auschwitz-Birkenau; but I kid you not, I was genuinely fucking *shaking* as I held the Israeli flag there.

It's strange, because I'd always imagined that in a situation like this, I would stand my ground and confront antisemitism.

I was not aware of the hate crimes and antisemitism that Jews experience; I thought it had been over for a long time now. I did not know many of you fear getting attacked simply for being Jewish. I did not believe your fears were justified. I am so, so sorry for that. 

I now see that I was wrong. Politics and personal biases and motivations aside, I now understand why zionism is required. I understand why Jews need a safe place where they are protected, a place to which they are indigenous. Just as I see and understand the horrors my family lived, I see and try my best to understand yours. I will continue to learn about your experiences and wholeheartedly defend your right to self determination. 

The support you show each other and the community you have created is so heart-warming. I am sorry I was not aware of the hate, fear and pain that you experience. I admire your ability to stand together and wish you all the love and safety in the world. I wish it didn't have to be so complicated. I'm writing this hoping that one day we can move on and accept each other's experiences so we can all coexist in peace.",2023-12-11 22:55:02,"From a non-Jew, I apologize for my lack of awareness",0.98,758,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jewish/comments/18g5exl/from_a_nonjew_i_apologize_for_my_lack_of_awareness/

# Disclaimer to all students

At this point, the 61B lecture is over. If you want to go, you can. But this is actually my last lecture for the semester. Justin is lecturing the rest of the way; it's all optional fun stuff. Since this is my last chance to talk to you all, and also to those out in the recording in the world, I have a couple of things I want to say. I want to make it clear that this is only on my behalf. Like nobody on the 61B staff knows about this. No one actually knows about this, period. Like Justin, do you know what I'm about to say at all? Like I haven't told you, right? Okay.

I just wanted to leave you with some thoughts about life, and what you've learned, and what you can take forward from this class in general. That's what I want to talk about. This lecture is over, so if you want to go, you can go. You can just pretend that I have left and then I just came back, and this is a lecture hall that no one is using. Is that fair? Everyone knows the lecture is over. You can go home. I'm not here as your instructor or whatever. I'm just some guy who found an empty lecture hall and is here talking. Is that fair? Okay, I am recording this. Yeah, okay. Hopefully, it's okay with everyone. I just want to make sure.

With that in mind, again, if you want to go, leave halfway through. I don't care. Something I do want to say is, I mean, this is something I've been spending a lot of time thinking about, and something I've been spending my weekends thinking about as well.

&#x200B;

# Some context

I don't know if you all have been following the news or whatever, but there's been a situation going on in Gaza. The news stories that come out just break my heart, man. They've been bombing hospitals, they've been bombing schools, and they've been killing journalists, children, women. The thing about Gaza, which I don't know how many, you know, I had to learn as well and get informed too, but is everyone aware that in Gaza, you can't leave? This is not, ""Oh, I can just go somewhere else, whatever."" There's a blockade happening there by the Israeli government, and it means that the people inside cannot leave. There's no option to go. There's no airport to leave. There are no boats taking people out. It is a closed, open-air prison is what people are calling it because you can't leave.

That is something that I think maybe a lot of people don't realize, but I wanted to get the word out there. Something else is that, because there's this blockade, resources can't go inside either. This blockade means that the Israeli government gets to decide what goes in and out (correction: Rafah border crossing is controlled by Egypt, but Israel has cut off all humanitarian aid to Gaza from its border crossings). So they have stopped the flow of electricity. These people inside don't have power to power their hospitals or cook food. They don't have water. They don't have food. Supplies are running out. There are hospitals that just can't function because they've been bombed or because there's no electricity to support it.

The reason why I'm saying all this, by the way. I'm sorry to throw all this emotion on you, but I'll link it back to 61B and why we're all here in just a moment. I just wanted to make sure we're all aware of the situation. If you're not, literally just go on Google. The horror stories I see every day break my heart.

&#x200B;

# Qualifying my position

So, at this point, I know that people are about to come for my job. I was already told I shouldn't be doing this. Before you come for my job or whatever, I need to dispel a couple of things. I know when I'm talking to my bosses, they'll say, ""Oh, you didn't condemn Hamas,"" whatever. Hopefully, I have made it very clear that I am not in favor of bombing innocent civilians in hospitals, schools, whatever.

But I also do want to remind you all that the attacks that happened in October are not an excuse to bomb people back. That's not how that works. You don't just say, ""Oh, well, some people got bombed so I'm going to bomb them back."" That's not how that works, okay?

I also want to remind you that history did not start in October. We were here talking about Java before October. There were things that happened before the attacks in October. There's 75 years of Palestinian history of oppression, ethnic cleansing, genocide that's been happening for the past 75 years. There have been people in Palestine who've been taken political prisoner for decades and haven't been awarded a fair trial or anything at all.

So, sure, we talk about releasing the Israeli hostages, and I'm in favor of that too. But let's also, at the same time, not be afraid to talk about the Palestinian hostages who are being held by the Israeli government. Let's not be afraid to talk about the hostages who are in Gaza and cannot leave. I think that's a hostage situation too.

If anyone wants to accuse me of being a terrorist sympathizer or whatever, I want to make it very clear that I'm not, and that's not what I'm here for. If you want to also come to me, ""Oh, you're anti-Semitic and anti-Israel,"" I want to make it clear that anti-Semitism is not anti-Zionism. They are different things.

When I was out here, by the way, these are all my own photos from the past four, five weekends (showing slides containing images of local pro-Palestine demonstrations). When we are out here, I'm not standing against my Jewish brothers, sisters, and siblings, but I'm standing with them because we say that we don't want this to happen again and not in their name. I just wanted to get that out there in case I get fired or whatever. I am not sympathizing with terrorists or anything that may be interpreted that way.

&#x200B;

# Why I care about this

So, I realized I just dropped a lot of stuff on you. Now I want to bring it back to why this matters to you, why this matters to me. You might be thinking, ""Credit to you for saying this, but this isn't the only thing that's happening in the world. Why haven't you talked about anything else that's been happening?"" And you know what? Maybe you're right. But one other thing that I really want to emphasize that makes this so important to us and makes it so that this is not something that's just happening to other people in the world who are, you know, on the other side of the globe, why does it concern me? It's who is funding this.

The US is the biggest backer of Israel and its current bombing campaign in Gaza. My tax dollars are being used to fund the bombing of children, hospitals, schools, universities, safe zones. As someone who is funding this, I think I have a right to say something against it. I did not consent to using my money for this. You might say, ""Let's just go vote out the people who said this."" But who do I vote for? I look in the Senate. They're voting like 97 to 0 to give Israel more funding. In the Senate, 97 to 0 means everyone from Ted Cruz to Bernie Sanders votes for it. Do you know how hard it is to get Ted Cruz and Bernie Sanders to agree on something? And they agree on this. Give me a break.

So, I think if my tax dollars are being used to fund this, and your tax dollars are being used to fund this, I think I have a right to say something about it in the space that I have. Maybe it's selfish of me to say, ""Oh, I have a space here to talk about it,"" but I think you do too. This is where I'm going to bring it back to 61B.

&#x200B;

# How this relates to you

So, what have you learned in this class? Sure, I could sit here and tell you all about, oh, we learned about a summary of sorting, we talked about priority queues, but, you know, to be realistic, are you really going to remember what radix sort is in like 10 years without looking it up? Probably not. Okay, and that's okay. I'm not offended. You know, I didn't remember what LLRB's where before I came and taught this class again, and that was like, you know, five, six years ago for me.

But what I really want you to take away from this class personally, and maybe everyone else has different opinions, and that's okay, but I think that from 61B, what you have gained is the power to be successful. I don't know how else to say this really, but you've gained the privilege to get a Berkeley degree in computer science, which is not just some crummy piece of paper. The Berkeley degree in computer science or data science is going to unlock so many opportunities and paths for you to be successful out there.

You can go out and get a software engineering job that pays twice or three times whatever the hell I make. You can go out and do consulting work or engineering and build amazing, complicated things and contribute to massive projects that change governments, change how we live as a society, change the world. Right? If you go work for a tech company, Facebook, Google, whatever, you're changing the way in which people in the world get information.

Or if you go out and work for the government or work for any of these major companies, or go out and design self-driving cars, you're changing the way that people get around or you're changing the world, really. You have been given the power to go out and use everything you've learned in this class, the ability to write all this complex code, manage the complexity, and work with other people. You've been given the privilege and the power to go out and change the world.

So what I really want to impress on you is that because you have been given this power, I think it's important to know what that power can be used for.

&#x200B;

# The importance of ethics in technology

And I know that there's already been talk; I'm sure you've heard all about, you know, oh, there's ethics in AI and, you know, there's, uh, I don't know, you know, all these other, like, tech-related things, and you're like, ""Wait a minute, you know, this Gaza thing, sure, it's an issue, but what does it have to do with me? I'm someone who's going to work in engineering and technology. So what does this have to do with me?"" But it does, right?

So, something I've heard from all the people that I've talked to out here, and you know, I've been trying my best to listen, and I'm not going to sit up here and pretend, like, ""Well, I'm an expert, listen to me, whatever."" I'm just one guy who's trying to do his best to learn about the issues. So one thing I've heard from a lot of people which really resonated with me is that we are not free until Palestine is free. So what does that mean? Well, I think you can interpret it lots of different ways. I'm not going to tell you how to interpret it, but to me, what it means is that all of our struggles are interconnected.

So when you go out and work for something like, let's go develop some AI that's going to recognize people's faces or whatever, well, that kind of technology is something that all these armies are using to identify people and protesters and try to prosecute them. Like, that's connected. Or, you know, if you go out and work for social media companies, right? You're like, ""Wait, that's nothing to do with me. What does it have to do with all this stuff? I thought this is not related to me. I'm the CS major. Get this, like, liberal arts crap away from me.

""But, um, it's connected because if you go out and work for some social media company, like, think about all the disinformation we've been seeing about this conflict. We've been seeing, you know, I mean, heck, even the fact that people are calling it a conflict, and people think, ""Oh, it's a war between two sides that have equal capability."" It's not a war. It's a genocide. There's one side that is absolutely being wiped out and bombed indiscriminately, and I think that's something that's not getting out there. And as someone who designs social media platforms and has the ability to go and change the way in which people receive information, you too have a big place in this struggle. It's not just, ""Oh, I'm a CS major. There's nothing to do with CS."" They're connected, okay.

&#x200B;

# Funding and Priorities

And I mean, even for me, sure, I don't have a tech job or whatever, but I work in education. Even something like the education sector, I feel connected to this too. So, think about it. Has anyone had trouble getting into 61B or any other classes? Has that been something everyone's been experiencing? Once you get to the upper divs, I promise you'll have trouble getting into classes, no question, right? Has everyone been experiencing those 100-minute office hour wait times that we're trying our best to get through? You know those, right? Or even just posting on Ed, waiting two days, no answer because there's just so few of us and so many of you, right? We're all underpaid, overworked. There are too many of you coming in, but why does it have to be that way?

Why is it that, you know, I have to be here, teaching all these different classes, and all of our TAs have to, you know, we tell them not to overwork, but we end up all just doing what we can to help you, and we still can't get to all of you. Why do we have to turn you away when you need help? Well, why aren't we funded? Why is the EECS department so chronically underfunded this way? I'm not saying there's a direct correlation. I'm not going to accuse the EECS department of whatever. But as a state-funded school and as a government-funded, publicly funded university, there are priorities in this country, and somehow the priority in this country is not to fund the education that you are paying a load of tuition for.

Somehow, all this money is getting funneled into sending bombs to other countries so they can bomb children in hospitals. Like, you know, that's something that resonates with me because I think that part of my struggle to get you all the education that I think you deserve is connected to the fact that our governments are okay with underfunding the EECS Department over and over and over again until we have no money left to support any of you. Meanwhile, it seems like every time Israel needs more bombs, they can always pull up the money that they need. How? How can that be right?

&#x200B;

# It doesn't feel right

So, I find those kind of things connected. When I see the people of Palestine band together and live through really what is just some of the most horrific things, like, I've ever seen in my life, I see that stuff. I don't even know if I can watch it sometimes. Like God. And, you know, when I see this stuff, part of me, of course, feels like pity and sympathy. Part of me feels anger—anger that my tax dollars are being used to fund it, anger that your tax dollars and tuitions are being used to fund it. I mean, what kind of tuition are you paying to get this kind of subpar staff support? I'm okay with saying it. Like, we do our best, but it's ultimately not what you deserve. What kind of tuition are you paying? I paid like five figures, you know? I don't know how much are we talking these days. Has tuition gone up recently? I don't even know. Forget the housing and all that. What, 100,000, 200,000? I don't know, man. It's just so much, and you're not getting what you deserve as students.

I think that, you know, even there, the struggle is interconnected. We are connected to these people in ways that even I'm still learning about. Anyway, when I see these things, you know, some part of me feels pity and sympathy, and part of me feels anger again that I'm here and I can do anything about it. My representatives are all out there voting to send them more bombs, and there's nothing I can do about it, except I guess, you know, selfishly come up here and waste all of your time talking about this.

&#x200B;

# Standing in solidarity

Something else that I feel, which I think is so much stronger than any of those other feelings of pity or sympathy or even anger, is at a very deep level, I feel solidarity with these people. The people of Palestine are out here suffering things that I will never, ever have to suffer, God willing, and things that I will never be able to even imagine—the horrors of an entire family being wiped out. There are people whose entire families have been wiped out, and that last name just doesn't exist anymore. I just think about that, and I'm like, how can I even imagine what that's like? There are people out there who have lost their homes, have been forced to go to other places, and then still been bombed. I can't imagine what that's like.

And again, I think it's fair to feel pity and sympathy, and I think that's a valid thing to feel. But I also, on a deep level, feel solidarity. The people of Palestine give me the bravery to stand up here and tell you about this, even if it costs me my job, my reputation, whatever. Like, I think this is important enough to come up here and tell you about it. And, again, I want to remind you that all these struggles, to me, they're interconnected. So when you go out and you have the power to change the world, really—I know it sounds so utopian and like, really, but, you know, software and computer science really is one of these forefront fields.

When you go out, when you have the power to write code that is complex and the ability to manage it, and heck, the ability to take the stuff we've learned, use it in your software engineering interviews, and get all the jobs that you want, that kind of thing gives you power. It gives you privilege. You might have the money to do something about this. You might have the ability to contribute to companies that are either actively supporting or opposing or doing something about injustices like this.

&#x200B;

# Parting thoughts

Hey, maybe like 10 years down the line, there will be something else that comes up, and that's okay. I don't need you to remember any specific struggle or whatever, but I want you to remember that this overall struggle for justice, for equality, it is something that we are all in together. When you go out and when you go out with this power that we've given you, the power to, again, really change the world with the ability to program and construct software that you've been given, I just want to remind you that that power comes with a lot of responsibility. I really hope that when you go out, you remember that even though maybe CS on the surface doesn't seem connected to all of this, it is all connected. I feel solidarity with the Palestinian people. I feel that they give me the bravery to say this as an educator, and I hope they give you the bravery to go out and take a stand for things like this and do what's right.

Again, I know this wasn't super appropriate. If you want to report me and get me in trouble for it, like, fine, whatever. One other thing is, I don't feel like I'm super qualified to talk about all this either. (Asks anyone from the audience to share their thoughts afterward.) That's really all I want to say. So again, it's been a good semester. I'll still be around, of course. So, yeah, thanks for coming to all the lectures. I appreciate it. Of course, it is, you know, free Palestine all day, every day, and I want you to remember that your struggle and the Palestinian people's struggle and all of our struggles are interconnected, and I want you to remember to feel that solidarity. So, that's all I have. Thanks for your time, and I'll see you next time.

Every single one of them being blown to pieces by Israeli airstrikes. Infants that have died in their incubators due to Israel cutting off electricity. The use of white phosphorus a deadly chemical is automatic war crime. The Israel government likes to spread the information that the Palestinians have kidnapped Israeli citizens so wouldn’t bombing those areas mean they would kill the “kidnapped Israelis too”?
While Israeli’s are having there rooftop parties their government is committing a genocide. Noah schnapp has been pretty actively supporting the Israeli government on his social media.

A [WSJ/Ipsos poll](https://www.wsj.com/politics/elections/americans-back-israel-but-are-wary-of-getting-pulled-into-conflict-wsj-ipsos-poll-finds-3abce44b#) from 20 Oct found an increase from 27% to 42% Americans taking the Israeli side, and a decrease from 7% to 3% taking the Palestinians' side, compared to before Hamas' massacre. 75% Americans have a favourable view of the Israeli people, up from 67% in 2022.

Regarding the U.N. Resolutions, the GA has always been heavily against Israel, because of the Arab voting block. [This](https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/17jcuwa/comment/k71ixpt/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) is a good overview:

> Because Arab lobbying bloc. It is a guaranteed ~100 votes from the OIC nations and poor African states, as well as a few key abstentions from East Asia for almost every resolution. The Arabs can pretty much strongarm anything through the UNGA. [...] This is why Israel realized as early as the 1960s, that it was no use reacting to every UNGA resolution. Abba Eban, one of Israel's biggest diplomatic figures, quipped:""If Algeria introduced a resolution declaring that the earth was flat and that Israel had flattened it, it would pass by a vote of 164 to 13 with 26 abstentions.""

Remember that the [UN GA Resolution 3379](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly_Resolution_3379), declaring Zionism itself ""a form of racism and racial discrimination"", was in effect between 1975-91. The international support for Israel has risen significantly since then.

Even the Arab world has sticked by the Abraham accords, all the while condemning Israel in words. For example, the Chairmen of Foreign Affairs Committee at the UAE Federal National Council [said today](https://ejpress.org/are-the-abraham-accords-stronger-thant-the-war-between-israel-and-hamas/) that ""The [Abraham] Accords are our future"" and ""We want everyone to acknowledge and accept that Israel is there to exist"". The Saudis too have [indicated](https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/17g2cnf/white_house_saudis_mbs_indicates_israel/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) that normalisation is still on the cards once the war with Hamas is over.

Right now, on **social media**, the Israel/Palestine conflict is basically a battle of optics between propagandists.

The Pro-Israel side is trying to paint their opposition as anti-semites that want to genocide Jewish people.

The Pro-Palestine side is trying to paint their opposition as Zionists that want to genocide the Palestinian people.

[This clip of Destiny’s debate with Dan Cohen last night perfectly displays this](https://streamable.com/u5gyge):

> *Dan Cohen randomly interrupts Destiny *

> Dan Cohen: “Why are you a **Zionist**?! You’re an American streamer. Why are you so fanatically committed to Zionism?”

> Destiny: “I’m not fanatically committed to Zionism. If I have a fanatic commitment to anything, it’s ‘what is a realistic solution to the current problem that exists?’”

> Dan Cohen: “Why are you **against democracy**?”

> Destiny: “That question is so meaningless that it doesn’t mean anything.”

> Dan Cohen: “My proposal is very simple: I just think everyone should have the same rights in that country, just like all other countries. Why do you **oppose democracy**?”

> Destiny: “It’s not a matter of opposing democracy. In the cartoon, where Benjamin Franklin is quoted as saying democracy is 2 wolves and a lamb having a vote on what to have for lunch. Do you th-”

> Dan Cohen: “Ah, so you think there’s some kind of inherent difference between Palestinians and Israelis.”

> Destiny: “Do you think Ben Franklin didn’t support democracy for that quote?”

> Dan Cohen: “No. You **oppose democracy**, man. Just admit it. You think Palestinians are **subhuman**.”

> Destiny: “I don’t know where that came from. Do you think Benjamin Franklin opposed democracy because he said liberty is a well-armed lamb contesting the vote. Do you think he was opposing democracy if the 2 wolves wanted to eat, and the lamb didn’t want to be eaten? Was that him opposing democracy?”

> Dan Cohen: “The analogy here is that you’re saying that Jewish Israelis are lambs, and Palestinians or Arabs are all wolves. That’s straight up **racist**, man. It’s just totally anti-Palestinian **racism**.”

And then immediately after their debate ended, Dan Cohen Tweeted out a clip from their debate and claimed Destiny wants to genocide all Palestinians. [**The Tweet currently has 1.7 million views and 14k likes in just 12 hours**](https://twitter.com/dancohen3000/status/1722417199875297653)

It’s good that Destiny put in so much time to do research on this conflict. But facts, alone, are not enough when debating people like this.

# Attacking vs Building: How Destiny's Debate Style Hurts Him

One big issue that Destiny has when he debates people is that he puts almost all of his focus on **attacking** the person’s arguments, but he doesn’t put nearly enough effort into **building** up his own beliefs on the subject during the debate.

For example, if Destiny were to debate a person that claims Game of Thrones is the best TV show in history that has no flaws, Destiny would spend almost all of this time pointing out every flaw in Game of Thrones. And to the audience, he would sound like he hates everything about the show. And if Destiny were to debate someone that says Game of Thrones is complete shit and is one of the worst shows in TV history, Destiny would mostly focus on pointing out all the good aspects of the show, and he would likely come off as a hardcore fan of the show. In both of these debates, the audience would have no clue about Destiny's true feelings towards Game of Thrones because he never paints a full picture of his perspective in either one.

Using this style of debating against a propagandist can severely hurt you because their only goal is to make you look like you hate their side. So when Destiny spends so much time saying positive things about Israel and negative things about Palestine because his opponent is doing the opposite, Dan Cohen will just constantly repeat things like “Zionist”, “You oppose democracy”, “Racist”; and it will carry more weight to his audience because all they see is Destiny attacking the Palestinian side.

If Destiny wants to continue to debate these type of people in the future, he needs to work on building out his **full perspective** on the matter (during the debate) and what he believes needs to be done to help both Palestinians and Israelis. Otherwise, people will constantly try to paint him as someone that hates Palestinians and has no sympathy towards their plight.

This is why when Destiny debated that Zionist a bit over a week ago, to people who aren't familiar with Destiny, [he sounds like a completely different person compared to when he is debating against pro-Palestinian people](https://streamable.com/8p7ntm).",2023-11-09 15:09:15,Debating Propagandists: Destiny needs to remember what he learned from debating Vaush,0.98,642,https://www.reddit.com/r/Destiny/comments/17rdqwy/debating_propagandists_destiny_needs_to_remember/

""Letter to the New York Times: New Palestine Party: Visit of Menachem Begin and Aims of Political Movement Discussed

To the Editors of the New York Times: Among the most disturbing political phenomena of our times is the emergence in the newly created state of Israel of the ""Ereedom Party"" (Tnuat Haherut), a political party closely akin in its organization, methods, political philosophy and social appeal to the Nazi and Fascist parties. It was formed out of the membership and following of the former Irgun Zvai Leumi, a terrorist, right- wing, chauvinist organization in Palestine. The current visit of Menachem Begin, leader of this party, to the United States is obviously calculated to give the impression of American support for his party in the coming Israeli elections, and to cement political ties with conservative Zionist elements in the United States. Several Americans of national repute have lent their inconceivable that those who oppose fascism throughout the world, if correctly informed as to Mr. Begin's political record and perspectives, could add their names and support to the movement he represents.

Before irreparable damage is done by way of financial contributions, public manifestations in Begin's behalf, and the creation in Palestine of the impression that a large segment of America supports Fascist elements in Israel, the American public must be informed as to the record and objectives of Mr. Begin and his movemnent.

The public avowals of Begin's party are no guide whatever to its actual character. Today they speak of freedom, democracy and anti-imperialism, whereas until recently they openly preached the doctrine of the Fascist state. It is in its actions that the terrorist party betrays its real character; from its past actions we can judge what it may be expected to do in the future.

Attack on Arab Village

A shocking example was their behavior in the Arab village of Deir Yassin. This village, off the main roads and surrounded by Jewish lands, had taken no part in the war, and had even fought off Arab bands who wanted to use the village as their base. On April 9 (THE NEW YORK TIMES), terrorist bands attacked this peaceful village, which was not a military objective in the fighting, killed most of its inhabitants240 men, women, and childrenand kept a few of them alive to parade as captives through the streets of Jerusalem. Most of the Jewish community was horrified at the deed, and the Jewish Agency sent a telegram of apology to King Abdullah of Trans-Jordan. But the terrorists, far from being ashamed of their act, were proud of this massacre, publicized it widely, and invited all the foreign correspondents present in the country to view the heaped corpses and the general havoc at Deir Yassin.

The Deir Yassin incident exemplifies the character and actions of the Freedom Party.

Within the Jewish community they have preached an admixture of ultranationalism, religious mysticism, and racial superiority. Like other Fascist parties they have been used to break strikes, and have themselves pressed for the destruction of free trade unions. In their stead they have proposed corporate unions on the Italian Fascist model.

During the last years of sporadic anti-British violence, the IZL and Stern groups inaugurated a reign of terror in the Palestine Jewish community. Teachers were beaten up for speaking against them, adults were shot for not letting their children join them. By gangster methods, beatings, window-smashing, and wide-spread robberies, the terrorists intimidated the population and exacted a heavy tribute.

The people of the Freedom Party have had no part in the constructive achievements in Palestine. They have reclaimed no land, built no settlements, and only detracted from the Jewish defense activity. Their much-publicized immigration endeavors were minute, and devoted mainly to bringing in Fascist compatriots.

Discrepancies Seen

The discrepancies between the bold claims now being made by Begin and his party, and their record of past performance in Palestine bear the imprint of no ordinary political party. This is the unmistakable stamp of a Fascist party for whom terrorism (against Jews, Arabs, and British alike), and misrepresentation are means, and a ""Leader State"" is the goal.

In the light of the foregoing considerations, it is imperative that the truth about Mr. Begin and his movement be made known in this country. It is all the more tragic that the top leadership of American Zionism has refused to campaign against Begin's efforts, or even to expose to its own constituents the dangers to Israel from support to Begin.

The undersigned therefore take this means of publicly presenting a few salient facts concerning Begin and his party; and of urging all concerned not to support this latest manifestation of fascism.

,16wp179,217,,r/itcouldhappenhere,"A sibling of mine has become increasingly radicalized online over the past couple of years, but in the last few months it has gained some serious momentum and I'm starting to get concerned. I have been hearing him mention terms and concepts which I know to only be associated with straight up white supremacist poison. It seemed like for a few years after Trump, his views skewed and faltered slightly from broad norms. Then came Qanon, lizard-people, pedo-rings, etc etc. Covid exacerbated the issue. He protested mask mandates (like, tried to do unmasked sit-ins and shit), and was convinced the vaccine was a mechanism -emphasis on \*machine\*- ""they"" would use to kill us en mass. Then last year, it turned into Zionism. He keeps these things locked tightly inside, they only slip out occasionally. We have a very small, spread out family. My sibling is on the west coast, I'm in the south, and my dad is in the Great Lakes. My brother ONLY speaks to my dad (2+ times a day) and me (once a week is about all I can handle). So over the last year, as the antisemitism crept in, I became increasingly frustrated when our conversations would turn towards such topics so our phone calls became shorter, angrier, and less frequent. The wild thing is, our conversations will be completely normal...until they aren't. Suddenly. Our most recent conversation turned extremely ugly, I try not to let things devolve, but I get so spittin mad at some of the absurd shit that falls from his mouth. So I had avoided talking to him for about a month, trying to make a point. So, tonight we had our first conversation since, and things have gotten much, much worse. Zionism has turned into straight up Nazism. White supremacy. He admitted to spending all of his time on 4chan, the politically incorrect board specifically, 8chan, and youtube. 

He has no friends. He is completely antisocial. He can't hold a job, or a place to live very long. He recently tried to get into the marines, but couldn't make it to bootcamp because he wouldn't get vaccinated. (Or so he says).

My brother has gone through extreme personality changes in the last couple of years. He's always been progressive, left-leaning, he's gay (out in middle school), sensitive, loving, and kind. Now he's hateful, he's been going to Russian Orthodox Church (what in the fuuuuuuuck), tried getting into the military (this kid can't drive and has never in his human existence been in combat with anyone other than me when we were five), he is full of hate, hates everyone and everything. And this has all happened so quickly. It keeps getting more and more extreme and I do not know what to do. Because there's only so many places this goes. And I'm terrified. He's a 29 year old adult who lives on his own, in a city where no one knows him. The only two people on the planet with even the slightest notion of his reality are my dad and I and I can't just sit on this anymore. Like. How do I reach down his throat and grab the pill he's swallowed?

I know this is a fucking podcast thread. But straight up I do not know where to turn, my friends know fuck all in regards to these things, so here's hoping someone anyone has any resources or experience with this kind of utterly deplorable shit.",2023-10-01 03:16:57,"Advice needed, little brother is currently swallowing a red pill, kind of desperate-- very freaked out.

Now, it's all turned around. The media, talk show hosts, newspapers and even Alex Jones. Israel is enemy #1... While I would like to believe that everyone has suddenly woken up and is finally being truthful, I feel like there may be an agenda.

Perhaps this is paranoia speaking, but what if the globalists are planning something terrible and have decided Israel will be the one to either be blamed outright, or blamed in case something goes wrong with their plan, the fall guy.

I don't believe for a second that Stephen Colbert would say anything anti-Israel/anti-IDF as he did recently after the 7 humanitarian workers were killed. This type of behavior got you instantly cancelled in American media. Yet here we are.

Praximus here. Reddit has decided to permaban me due to my unconditional support of Palestine. I am here to spill the tea and to also give my account the proper sendoff it deserves  
========The Permaban and Zionist influence on Reddit==========  


Firstly, the only regret I have is not being banned from r/Israel before my expulsion.  


What else can we expect from this garbage website that throws the same superior third-party apps under the bus that made them profitable and viable in the first place? A reminder that we indeed opened this sub back up under duress: [https://www.reddit.com/r/ENLIGHTENEDCENTRISM/comments/163n6pn/renlightenedcentrism\_is\_officially\_reopened/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ENLIGHTENEDCENTRISM/comments/163n6pn/renlightenedcentrism_is_officially_reopened/)  


Without apps like Reddit is Fun and Baconreader this website would have fallen to the abyss like Digg did in 2009. With this newfound focus on profitability, there have been some changes to the Reddit admins and upper staff. Like Jessica Ashooh who is a former US State official and member of the Atlantic Council:  
[https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/expert/jessica-ashooh/](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/expert/jessica-ashooh/)  


Yeah, THAT Atlantic Council. The brain trust of NATO and writes such eloquent pieces such as:  
[https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/insight-impact/in-the-news/oren-in-defense-of-zionism/](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/insight-impact/in-the-news/oren-in-defense-of-zionism/)  
and has a rather telling agenda on Israel: [https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/region/israel/](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/region/israel/)  


So if you're seeing a pro-Israel slant on Reddit, let it be known that it is intentional and curated.  With that said, let's go ahead and talk about the ban itself.  


I posted a video of Hamas soldiers celebrating a ceasefire with music overlap. This video has already circulated on Reddit in various subs and was in the news:  


[https://np.reddit.com/r/Ultraleft/s/rNkJNLi94V](https://np.reddit.com/r/Ultraleft/s/rNkJNLi94V)

[https://np.reddit.com/r/whenthe/s/wHKPy8vl2P](https://np.reddit.com/r/whenthe/s/wHKPy8vl2P)  


Even Facebook has the original footage:  
[https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=146313147529713](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=146313147529713)  


Make no mistake, the reason why the post was taken down was due to brigading efforts by r/israel and r/antisemitism. Subs that utilize false accusations of antisemitism to justify the continued genocide in Palestine.  


The types of users in these subs can be summarized by just two posts:

The crime isn't supporting terrorism, this is obvious. The crime is bringing attention to those who wish for its continuance. Furthermore, my account was in good standing prior to this. In fact, just two months ago Reddit offered me my very own chat channel that they only offered to 50 select Redditors:  


[https://matrix.redditspace.com/\_matrix/media/r0/download/reddit.com/eyapzdlzx7dc1](https://matrix.redditspace.com/_matrix/media/r0/download/reddit.com/eyapzdlzx7dc1)  


My account was in good standing and popular before my explicit support for Palestine. After all, why would Reddit offer something so exclusive to me if I wasn't controversial? Let it be clear: Reddit caved to zionist pressure and brigading. The accusations of ""supporting terrorism"" are bunk: [https://matrix.redditspace.com/\_matrix/media/r0/download/reddit.com/dd3ttssiy7dc1](https://matrix.redditspace.com/_matrix/media/r0/download/reddit.com/dd3ttssiy7dc1)  


I think I've made my point about the ban itself. Again, besides not getting banned from a few zionist subreddits on the way out I have no regrets.  


======== The fun part ============  


I had two intended purposes to my bit  
1 - Demonstrate that satire about Libertarianism is indistinguishable from what they actually believe. This was done with my former account but continued with Praximus  
2- Spread communist propaganda unapologetically through subtext - Exclusively with Praximus after I realized the impact I had on my former account.  


My former account Aryan\_Rand\_Galt\_CCC accomplished this far better than I could have imagined. All I did was take memes from this sub (r/enlightenedcentrism) and post it into r/Libertarian shamelessly. They all never failed to get upvoted. Gee, I wonder why. They caught on to my ""As a Libertarian"" bit but of course failed to do it properly. This led to everyone on the subreddits accusing each other of ""not being real libertarians"" to my great amusement. Eventually, the Nazis and white supremacists felt comfortable enough to just take their masks off in front of each other. This all resulted to me documenting and exposing them:  


[https://www.reddit.com/r/ENLIGHTENEDCENTRISM/comments/a5iomj/as\_a\_libertarian\_its\_time\_for\_me\_say\_farewell/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ENLIGHTENEDCENTRISM/comments/a5iomj/as_a_libertarian_its_time_for_me_say_farewell/)  


This post was stickied on this sub for about a week by the former admins. (Some of those links and images are no longer valid. Apologies).  


Eventually, even Mother Jones wrote an article about it: [https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2018/12/reddit-libertarian-takeover-far-right/](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2018/12/reddit-libertarian-takeover-far-right/)  


There was no Chapo brigade. There was no one masquerading as white supremacists. There was no coordinated effort to make them look ""Worse than they are"". It was just me, doing my bit, and having them swim in the honeypot. Ultimately r/Libertarian banned memes because of this and why there's now r/libertarianmeme. Additionally,  the mods of r/Libertarian were exposed to be blatant white supremacists and got forcibly removed and demodded due to my efforts.  


I didn't really have an intention to come back to Reddit and continue the bit after all this. I came back because I saw that my absence was felt. Also, I lost the password to my former account because to get into character I wanted to emulate losing a Bitcoin wallet password lolol. That's when I created Praximus.  


I'll end this with a couple of my favorite moments from the account.  


You know the now infamous screenshot of ""As a libertarian just say what you mean we'll know you're libertarian by what you say is wrong?"" Yeah, that was also me:  


[https://matrix.redditspace.com/\_matrix/media/r0/download/reddit.com/kg9oqi6l08dc1](https://matrix.redditspace.com/_matrix/media/r0/download/reddit.com/kg9oqi6l08dc1)  


The time I got a mod of r/Libertarian to delete his account because I literally quoted Rothbard (a prominent libertarian political theorist) and he thought I was ""promoting pedophilia"" lmao:  


[https://matrix.redditspace.com/\_matrix/media/r0/download/reddit.com/q73ytl8i28dc1](https://matrix.redditspace.com/_matrix/media/r0/download/reddit.com/q73ytl8i28dc1)  
One of the many times I accurately called out how predictable Libertarian Memes are:  
[https://matrix.redditspace.com/\_matrix/media/r0/download/reddit.com/wnpet874pedc1](https://matrix.redditspace.com/_matrix/media/r0/download/reddit.com/wnpet874pedc1)

Sometimes I create intentionally shitty memes to see if Libertarians will be dumb enough to cop them. This page fell for it on multiple occasions

There are of course many more. I have a Facebook account just called PraximusPrime where I post these on the daily if you want to follow.  
There was no better way for me to end this, IMHO. I am confident that history will smile upon me. I want to also clarify that -every- single one of my comments is backed by one I have witnessed in full earnest. Sometimes I didn't even need to change a thing:  


[https://matrix.redditspace.com/\_matrix/media/r0/download/reddit.com/4wj552qs38dc1](https://matrix.redditspace.com/_matrix/media/r0/download/reddit.com/4wj552qs38dc1)  


With a head held high, this is my departure. I'd like this to be the last screenshot I share as a Libertarian:  


[https://matrix.redditspace.com/\_matrix/media/r0/download/reddit.com/qnnc0suh38dc1](https://matrix.redditspace.com/_matrix/media/r0/download/reddit.com/qnnc0suh38dc1)  


And of course, the sauce: [https://twitter.com/LPNH/status/1561399303058382850?t=FDvSWKblLUBG-JFSQPrNCQ&s=19](https://twitter.com/LPNH/status/1561399303058382850?t=FDvSWKblLUBG-JFSQPrNCQ&s=19)  


There is no bigger insult to the victims of the Holocaust than using their memory to perpetuate and justify the same type of genocide and apartheid that they themselves experienced. May the Palestinian people achieve victory against their oppressors.  


I sincerely hope that my account has provided a few laughs to you all over the years. I have always been and will always be your comrade.

But existence leaves traces, and the imprint of the Palestine that was remains, even in the absence of those expelled from their lands. It appears in the ruins of a village whose name no longer appears in the maps, in the drawing of a lost landscape, in the lyrics of a song, or in the photographs from a family album.

Börjar med att jag hör rytmisk musik, ser sedan att den kommer från en grupp människor på torget där många har på sig/viftar med palestinska flaggor.

Sedan börjar sången som till att börja med är rätt standard.

""Leve, leve, leve palestina""

Som sagt inget anmärkningsvärt.

""Krossa, krossa, krossa zionismen""

Ok, detta kan ju vara kontroversiellt men beroende på exakt vad man menar med zionism så kan ju detta vara en rimlig ståndpunkt.

""Vi har, kastat stenar på poliser och soldater""

Ok nu börjar det ju spåra ur men om man vill tolka detta välvilligt så kan man ju tänka att de menar att de gjort motstånd mot övervåld.

""Vi har, vi har skju-u-tit raketer""

Ok nu finns det ju ingen välvilja i världen som kan omtolka detta till annat än stöd för terror, eller?

Asså vilka på den pro-palestinska sidan i den här konflikten är det som ""skjuter raketer""? Det är ju Hamas, Hizbollah och liknande grupper.

Jag trodde att argumentet från den pro-palestinska sidan var att man måste göra skillnad på Hamas och palestinier, och sedan så står man öppet på ett torg och skanderar detta!

Är jag orimlig i min tolkning av detta, missar jag något? Förstår verkligen inte logiken i detta.

The night is going well, we finished having dessert and were engaging in neutral conversation about school,cars, finals, and standardized tests coming up, making jokes; I think we were talking about which hillel member would be which harry potter character when they came.

Literally nothing inflammatory.

All of a sudden, a guy name ahmed comes in and says "" free donuts"" referring to the sufganiyot. He comes in wearing the kiffyah and 3 other guys follow him and they sit down. our hillel director, Melanie, asks him "" do you know anything about hannukah"" and they all shake their heads and say "" no not really."" before Melanie could explain, they say "" we're from the msa and sjp."" I immediately feel this weary feeling come over me and i'm so upset. They started talking to the hillel director and the hillel president about the israel palestine conflict. one of them leaves the table and asks the other member to teach him how to play dreidels ( not him i have the problem with, that's fine).

The problem I have is literally about these students crashing hanukkah. coming in, stealing food, and talking about their cause. It infuriates me how they always say "" we're just antizionist not anti jew"" but then think it's completely fine to crash a hannukah celebration to talk about ""palestinian injustice and struggle"". HE EVEN SAID HE HAS EXTREME VIEWS ON IT! I left right as things were getting heated because I was going to scream at them to get the fuck out.

I would just like to know. If it's about zionists and not jews, why crash a hanukkah celebration. Why go in and start a debate when it's clear it's not the place. Why take advantage of people's kindness? WHY? Why say all those things about israel and zionism and defend your members saying "" it's always the jews that steal"" but go into a hanukkah celebration that has nothing to do with it and crash it to talk about your bullshit. WHY?

Instead, it appears to cause two immediate effects: first it calls into question, especially by active dissidents of Israeli aggression, the legitimacy of the Zionist cause. In such cases it is clear that any dissent against the State of Israel or their atrocities including the inhumane treatment and genocide of Palestinians is often met with claims of antisemitism as if Israel has a right to commit war crimes because of the makeup of its population. Second, the flagrant use of the term dilutes its meaning. Clearly, it is a term that is being weaponized by part of the student body to intimidate sincere criticism of Israel and its current warmongering and its history of war crimes.

I’ll end with what is most obvious by the use of this propaganda: it is the tool of those who recognize that their positions have no meaning in righteousness, it constructs no meaning argument and instead is used to justify the oppression of peoples.

Anyway, I am thinking of wearing kippah to remind people that many Jews are ALSO against Israeli violence and genocide and to counteract the BS claims that anti Zionism = anti semitism. Just wanted to check if that would be alright, since I know that this is a sensitive situation. 

My kippah doesn’t have any Israeli symbolism in it- it’s decorated with birds and flowers, I got it on Etsy, and I’d get a sign and write “Anti-Zionism does not equal anti-semitism” on ot do there would be no confusion about what side I am on.

ETA: thank you guys for all the responses! I figured it would be okay but wanted to check, and I feel so much less alone seeing all the responses! I know that there are plenty of anti-Zionist Jews like me, and even big organizations like Jewish voice for peace and IJAN, but there are very few Jewish anti Zionists in my area, and it has left me feeling very isolated from my own culture, so it’s so nice and reassuring to see all the people here confirming how many of us there are. I feel a little less alone today❤️. Hopefully I can make it to the protest (it’s finals seasons and I have so much due this week and next), but even if I can’t, I feel less alone today. To my Palestinian brothers and sisters, I see you and I love you. From the River the sea, Palestine will be free!

I am once again debunking propaganda of sexual violence conducted by Hamas. For the remainder of this post, I am referring to [this article](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/28/world/middleeast/oct-7-attacks-hamas-israel-sexual-violence.html) by the NYT.

First, let's talk a little bit about the NYT. They parrot numerous pro-Israel talking points, such as [anti-Zionism being antisemitic](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/10/us/politics/anti-zionism-antisemitism.html). They have [slandered pro-Palestine groups](https://mondoweiss.net/2023/11/the-nytimes-continues-to-slander-and-silence-students-for-justice-in-palestine-and-jewish-voice-for-peace/). They have been described as a [""cheerleader for Israel and its crimes.""](https://electronicintifada.net/blogs/michael-f-brown/new-york-times-cheerleader-israel-and-its-crimes) It is clear that they often parrot Israeli propaganda. Will this article be any different?

**The Woman in the Black Dress**

It immediately starts off with some claim of a video about a woman in a black dress. The description seems to match [this video on an Israeli propaganda website](https://www.hamas-massacre.net/content/woman-who-was-raped-and-burned-to-death). Gal Abdush, the victim, was previously claimed to be killed [near the Supernova festival grounds](https://www.israelhayom.com/2023/10/20/operation-swords-of-iron-these-are-the-victims/).

Her face was ""burned beyond recognition,"" and this is an important piece of information. It has been proven that [Israel indiscriminately fired Hellfire missiles](https://electronicintifada.net/content/evidence-israel-killed-its-own-citizens-7-october/41156) on October 7th. At the aftermath of the festival attack, [dozens of cars were shown to be extremely burnt](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/abandoned-cars-underline-panic-israeli-music-festival-where-hamas-gunmen-killed-2023-10-09/). Hamas was only equipped with light weaponry, incapable of producing these burns. Mr. Abdush, the husband of Gal Abdush, was also identified to have been extremely burned. Basically, it seems highly plausible that Abdush's burns were due to a Hellfire missile.

The video was shot at October 8th, a complete day after the attack. It is entirely possible that the scene had been meddled with. Israel has done this in the past. For instance, Israel once [planted a rifle next to a killed Palestinian civilians](https://twitter.com/EuroMedHR/status/1711987165381497061) in an attempt to frame them as Hamas fighters. However, there is no conclusive evidence of this.

It later mentions that she was ""trapped on a highway in a line of cars trying to leave the party."" However, [the large majority of revelers managed to flee before the Hamas attack](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/18/hamas-had-not-planned-to-attack-israel-music-festival-israeli-report-says). This does not corroborate the claim made by NYT.

NYT then claims it ""verified"" video footage presented by the Israeli police which corroborate the claim she was raped. However, given then the Israeli police say they ""believe"" she was raped, it seems that all this video footage was of the aftermath. NYT's verification is only confirming the time and location of the video, not the actual claims made.

[Gal Abdush's sister](https://twitter.com/hoaxvstruths/status/1742182369207976005) does not believe that that she was raped.

In conclusion, there isn't sufficient evidence to say that Abdush was raped. The fact that she was greatly injured, and possibly even killed, by friendly fire significantly reduces Hamas involvement. The sister disagrees with NYT's allegation of rape, the allegation is not corroborated by other evidence.

**""Witness"" #1: Sapir**

Sapir is an anonymous witness to the Israeli police who claims that she saw atrocities by Hamas. Absolutely nothing of what she said can be verified or substantiated. It is all hearsay. A significant amount of what she claims is cartoonishly evil. Cartoonish supervillainry is a common theme in Israeli propaganda, attempting to paint Hamas as a group of ""savages.""

If it was a simple claim of rape, it would be more believable. However, the Israeli propagandists felt the need to go over-the-top in their atrocity propaganda. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, and none has been presented.

One specific claim from Sapir is that a Hamas fighter cut off a woman's breasts and threw it around like a ball. However, this exact scenario was claimed previously by some other propagandist, which was debunked in an [Mondoweiss investigation](https://mondoweiss.net/2023/12/cnn-report-claiming-sexual-violence-on-october-7-relied-on-non-credible-witnesses-some-with-undisclosed-ties-to-israeli-govt/). The fact that they are recycling a previously debunked claim is most certainly concerning about the credibility of the witness.

Sapir also claimed to see severed heads being thrown around. Once again, this is recycled propaganda, and has been debunked by the Mondoweiss investigation, but also before that in general because there are zero reports of decapitated heads.

Sapir claims she was hiding out-of-sight of the Hamas fighters, and that she also had a bullet wound which caused her to go in and out of consciousness. Under these circumstances, it seems highly unlikely she got a clear view of the Hamas fighters. It is very suspicious that she was able to describe things in such intense detail, despite her extensive obstructions to her visions.

She was able to provide photographs of her hiding place and her wounds. It seems plausible that the pictures of her supposed hiding place were taken after the incident, as she would likely not wanted to have moved to take a selfie. Regardless, the claims of atrocities are completely unsubstantiated.

Sapir's testimony lacks significant credibility, as it is regurgitating previous propaganda and making completely outlandish statements without evidence.

**""Witness"" #2: Yura Karol**

A friend of Sapir, he claimed he saw rape while providing zero supporting evidence. The NYT article does not go into detail in his account, and paints the Hamas fighters as rapists, but not cartoonishly evil. Still, the lack of evidence is deeply concerning. His connections to a likely propagandist also harms credibility.

**""Witnesses"" #3 and #4: Raz Cohen and Shoam Gueta**

They supposedly together when Cohen saw the alleged atrocity. Cohen once again describe Hamas as cartoonishly evil, and provide zero evidence or substantiation.

Cohen was interviewed many times in the past before, in which [he did not allege sexual violence](https://twitter.com/MaxBlumenthal/status/1740641517847335009). He once then made a claim of necrophilia, which he later dropped. He is NOT reliable. Shoam Gueta also does not describe mass rape occurring, further hindering its credibility.

**ZAKA Claims**

Finally, NYT cites ZAKA and other rescue groups for the claims of rape. However, an [investigation by The Gray Zone](https://thegrayzone.com/2023/12/06/scandal-israeli-october-7-fabrications/) revealed the extreme amount of corruption and deceit in these organizations. They have been fabricated atrocities to gain publicity, and thus obtain more donation money.

The NYT then tries to justify the lack of physical evidence from these organizations. However, these ""justifications"" were also used for the person who supposedly saw a baby baked in the oven, which United Hatzalah later retracted and blamed ""a volunteer who thought he saw such a case.""

Lots of the claims from ZAKA cited here were debunked in the Mondoweiss investigation.

**General**

Israel has been pushing disinformation about October 7th extensively. Reports with falsified and fabricated evidence such as these only serve as further justification for Israel's genocidal campaign against Gaza.

There is also substantial counter-evidence. One of the most major counter-evidence is the *actual* testimonies from released hostages and temporary captives. One Israeli mother wrote [a letter to Hamas](https://www.trtworld.com/middle-east/israeli-mothers-letter-to-hamas-thank-you-for-extraordinary-humanity-16005866) thanking them for their ""extraordinary humanity."" Another Israeli mother said that [she was unharmed by Hamas](https://twitter.com/RamAbdu/status/1711649368758005782). Yasmin Porat [said that](https://electronicintifada.net/content/israeli-forces-shot-their-own-civilians-kibbutz-survivor-says/38861) Hamas treated them humanely. An elderly Israeli woman says that [she was treated well in Gaza](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/24/israeli-captive-endured-hell-in-attack-but-treated-well-in-gaza). Released hostages of a mother and daughter also report [humane treatment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIMfc1y59mM), as well as a Hamas fighter avoiding direct hand contact in an arm wrestling match with the mother for religious reasons.  Why would a Hamas fighter simultaneously avoid bare-hand contact and commit sexual violence?

I know it may appear that I am dishonestly rejecting testimonies. However, when you describe cartoonish supervillainry, you must provide evidence. We should have learned from the Nayirah testimony to reject unsubstantiated claims like these.

,16pif5n,2610,,r/NoStupidQuestions,"It’s not like radical terrorist organizations completely went away after 9/11. In fact, they’re probably stronger than ever today as they’ve completely taken over the entire country of Afghanistan and large portions of Iraq and Syria. Not to mention the large anti-US sentiment in Iran due to decades of CIA back coups and sanctions. And Hamas in Palestine is not particularly fond of the US’ unwavering support of Israel. 

I understand that an attack on modern day America that is the scale of 9/11 would be virtually impossible. However, many countries don’t have anywhere near the airport security or intelligence agency capabilities that the US does. 

The reasons behind the 9/11 attacks also haven’t ceased. In fact, the West has meddled more in the Middle East and Africa more than they ever have in history over the past 22 years. That was the primary reason behind 9/11. 

Also, you would think that terrorist organizations would feel even more emboldened after seeing the failure of the US in Afghanistan and Iraq so an invasion wouldn’t deter them from doing a massive attack. 

So, what do you think has deterred anyone from doing something on the scale of 9/11 again?

Edit: Thank you all for the insightful feedback thus far. I’m trying my best to respond to as many as I can but I’m at work so it’s a bit difficult. I do want to clarify that I’m fully aware that there have been hundreds of terror attacks worldwide since 9/11. My question is more concerning as to why nobody has attempted an attack that could cause such earth shattering devastation and destruction like 9/11 that causes the entire world to react. They wouldn’t necessarily have to use the same tactics with planes.",2023-09-22 20:01:46,"I’m grateful that there hasn’t been another terror attack the scale of 9/11, but what has honestly stopped something like that from happening again elsewhere?",0.84,5502,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/16pif5n/im_grateful_that_there_hasnt_been_another_terror/

He told me that the more time he spends with Arabs, the more he realizes that Islam is nothing but an Arab Supermacist ideology used to give Arab a special privilege. 


Hearing these words coming from his mouth shocked me but also made me smile. I came out and told him that both me and my sister are no longer Muslims and he told me that I am a smart person for acknowledging that Islam is just a bullshit at young age while he felt ashamed for wasting time on praying and starving himself for decades for an imaginary Arab God.

advice,173uxrf,253,,r/travel,"Let me begin by saying that is is NOT political post and I have no intention of discussing any person's personal view towards Israel, Palestine, Hamas, or anything related to the current conflict. This sub is not the place.

What I do want to do is use this as a reminder of how quickly a fun trip can turn into a horror story. 

As adventure tourism has encouraged people to begin visiting untraditional destination many of us have discovered amazing new places, but it has also caused people to forget that many places are still unsafe.

Travel vloggers have also skewed are perception of countries by visiting places like Afghanistan and showing people how ""safe"" the country is for tourists. This misleads people into thinking that since the vlogger's trip was okay, the same thing should apply for their trip.

But what makes a country ""unsafe"" isn't the constant threat of violence, but rather the threat of a sudden flare-up which can plunge the location into total chaos. While I'm sure that the streets of Detroit and Philadelphia are more unsafe than the street of Kabul or Tel Aviv, the ceiling on danger is vastly different.

The ""worst case scenario"" is NOT the same for most destinations and that's what should be considered before you plan your next trip.

We've all heard of the people who were hurt at the music festival near Gaza. What has consistently gone through my mind since then is how all of them would have been just fine if the festival had been held just a week earlier. Everyone would have returned home and talked about how ""safe"" their trip to Israel had been.

I am not here to tell people where the should or shouldn't travel. I just want to turn this tragedy into a learning opportunity that will hopefully keep people safe in the future. Please thoroughly research your next vacation and don't just listen to a few anecdotal examples of a destination is ""safe"".",2023-10-09 16:39:35,"The quick break-out of war in Israel is a reminder of what makes countries ""unsafe""",0.91,3793,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/173uxrf/the_quick_breakout_of_war_in_israel_is_a_reminder/

I previously posted about hosting a debate between Ben Shapiro and Destiny. The debate was rescheduled to this month (January). So here we are again. This new post is a call for more questions and topics. 

If you have topics or question suggestions, let me know. I'm in particular looking for specific points of disagreement, either big or small. For example, they mostly agree on Israel-Palestine, but there might be nuanced disagreements that will be interesting to explore.

The big disagreement is on Biden & Trump. I'm trying to figure out exactly how to explore this. Do I go specific on Jan 6 or more broadly on why Biden and Trump each are a good/bad president for 2024. 

Also, I'm going to interview Destiny afterwards for 2-3 hours on other topics, if you have suggestions on that, let me know as well.

Many of us have observed that the current public sentiment feels deeply reminiscent of the nationalistic fervor and Islamophobia/anti-Arab racism that erupted in the wake of September 11th, 2001. I know there’s a lot of frustration and disappointment on this sub over the way many entertainers have responded to the ongoing crisis, so I hope this throwback post about a celebrity who was on the right side of history will be uplifting...

[Afghanistan, 2008](https://preview.redd.it/yu9a8jshvcvb1.jpg?width=1022&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8578ddebca4223ee555555aafbc40b7e122ad6a6)

9/11 inspired a historically unprecedented level of philanthropic giving. Within just two months, the world had raised a staggering [$1.2 billion](https://theguardian.com/world/2001/oct/31/september11.usa2) for charities helping the victims of the attacks in New York. The American Red Cross was eventually so overwhelmed by donations that they actually had to *stop* accepting them. Celebrities came out in droves to raise funds; Paul McCartney organized a star-studded [benefit concert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Concert_for_New_York_City) at Madison Square Garden, while George Clooney recruited [nearly every member](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1fihSpdEx8) of Hollywood's A-list for a telethon.

Amidst this outpouring of generosity, the United Nations refugee agency (UNHCR) implored the public to not forgot the other victims of terrorism: the millions of innocent Afghan civilians, both within the nation's borders and in the refugee camps of neighboring countries, who had by that point been suffering under Taliban oppression for five years, in addition to the decades of armed conflict and civil war that had preceded the Taliban's government takeover.

>Speaking in Washington on Tuesday, UN High Commissioner for Refugees Ruud Lubbers urged officials to carefully weigh the humanitarian consequences of any actions in Afghanistan.  
>  
>Reiterating his shock and sadness over last week's terrorist attacks, Lubbers said, ""It has galvanized a coalition against terrorism. That is good."" But he stressed the need ""to give all attention that is possible to the humanitarian aspects of possible reactions to this situation."" He warned that a ""too blunt and not specific enough"" reaction could mean ""disaster for many people, many innocent citizens.""  
>  
>He also urged the international community to help improve the situation for ""ordinary people"" in Afghanistan ""and then we can start again with our work there.""  
>  
>Lubbers, whose agency cares for nearly 22 million refugees and others of concern worldwide, also appealed to Americans to guard against any xenophobic backlash in the wake of the events. ""I am very glad that the opinion leaders in the United States were very open in saying let's take care not to nourish sentiments, feelings against foreigners, what is called xenophobia. Let us not do that."" \[[x](https://www.unhcr.org/news/afghanistan-humanitarian-update-no-3)\]

[Pakistan, 2005](https://preview.redd.it/66lus1cpvcvb1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4b1cafdea5527ff2692ef0b18e4b3046103b86d3)

On Sep 26th, UNHCR made a [formal appeal](https://avalon.law.yale.edu/sept11/unhcr_001.asp) for donations to respond to the “large-scale humanitarian emergency” in the region, explaining that the looming threat of US military retaliation would soon create a mass exodus of Afghan civilians fleeing for safety, and that those unable to run were at risk of starvation.

A day later, Angelina Jolie became the first person to answer the call, pledging one million dollars - the [largest donation](https://www.unhcr.org/news/afghanistan-humanitarian-update-no-10) UNHCR had ever received from a private individual.

Jolie was 26 at the time and had only recently begun her famous philanthropic partnership with the agency; she’d been [appointed](https://www.unhcr.org/news/news-releases/angelina-jolie-named-unhcr-goodwill-ambassador-refugees) a UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador just 15 days before 9/11. The appointment came on the heels of Jolie’s August 2001 visit to a refugee camp in Pakistan, where 2 million Afghans were already seeking asylum.

[Pakistan, August 2001](https://preview.redd.it/w9ooe6jvvcvb1.jpg?width=926&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4fb8f4e57d35f5b0016b664bc88a2c83bbbeac3c)

Years later, Jolie shared that she'd been in Japan on 9/11, and that the experience had been enlightening:

>""It was this other strange thing for me, because it was obviously a country where if you would have turned the clock back, it was an enemy. And now, on that date, for me as an American, they were my allies, my friends, taking care of me, giving me sympathy for my country. I became immediately conscious of how things shift, how the picture of the enemy shifts. I don't have any answers, but to be aware of all these things as it's coming down - it's not as simple as, Well, this is the bad guy."" \[[x](https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/interviews/a3136/angelina-jolie-interview-pics-0707/)\]

UN High Commissioner Ruud Lubbers thanked Jolie for her $1 million donation:

>”This significant contribution from a concerned young American reinforces my belief that, despite the trauma of recent events in her country, a strong sense of humanitarian responsibility toward innocent civilians suffering in far-off places continues to animate the spirit of caring individuals everywhere.”  
>  
>”The generosity of our good ambassador, Angelina Jolie, has encouraged all of us in the midst of an immense and complex emergency operation. We hope that others will follow her example and help us continue to protect the lives of the thousands of families fleeing their homes in Afghanistan."" \[[x](https://www.cnn.com/2001/US/09/28/rec.jolie.donation/index.html)\]

The same day that her donation was announced, Jolie made an appearance on CNN’s *Larry King Live* to advocate for the cause:

>JOLIE: “It's not a very popular thing to talk about. You know, at this time, people aren't really open to talking about that. But they are families just like our families... We all want the people who are responsible for the terrorist acts to be dealt with.”  
>  
>KING: “Sure.”  
>  
>JOLIE: “And severely. And yet I know there's not a person out there that wants these families, these millions of people, these refugees - they're in the millions, and it's 80 percent women and children.”  
>  
>KING: “And they're not terrorists.”  
>  
>JOLIE: “Not at all. They’re a beautiful people, and they're a tortured people, and they're surviving. And they're amazing people and they're amazing to me.” \[[x](https://transcripts.cnn.com/show/lkl/date/2001-09-27/segment/00)\]

To further impart the plight of Afghan refugees, the UNHCR website subsequently published Jolie's journals from her August 2001 visit to Pakistan. In a preface, she wrote:

>This journal was written weeks before the tragic events of September 11th. I ask people who read this to please keep that in mind. The needs have changed and maybe I would have felt a need to be more sensitive to the people who today can't help but think of Afghans without a feeling of anger.  
>  
>I want to ask people to please be open to the refugees. 80% are women and children. 20% are under five years of age. To understand they have been persecuted, their human rights have been violated and by the same people we consider a threat. You could say we share the same enemy. \[[x](https://web.archive.org/web/20020806140617/http://www.usaforunhcr.org/journal/pakjournal.html?current=0)\]

The journals are still available to read [at this link](https://web.archive.org/web/20020616002058/http://www.usaforunhcr.org/journal/pakjournal.html?current=1) (and in her 2003 book, *Notes From My Travels*), and include harrowing descriptions of families in mourning, the severely sick & disabled, and sexually exploited women & children. Please read with caution.

Jolie's decision to publicly advocate for Afghan civilians did not go over well with everyone. Howard Stern called her out on the air, describing her donation as ""odd."" Online [comments](https://groups.google.com/g/alt.support.childfree/c/Yj3xKS3vtjU/m/FRrPgewIQskJ) told her to ""rot in hell"" for being an ""American Traitor B\*tch."" She later revealed that she'd even received threatening hate mail:

>”I went on a show a few days after 9/11 to say that we needed to be focused on the Afghan people, the refugee families. We were focused on the Taliban as an enemy, and these people were their victims too. I got a phone call and two letters that said, very aggressively, how dare I say that we should help anyone else after September 11: ‘We should be helping everybody in New York and that’s it. F\*ck you! I hope your family dies, you’re anti-American.’ I was so shocked that I was actually nervous the first time I went back to New York a few months later.” \[[x](https://www.hollywood.com/celebrities/angelina-jolie-stunned-by-post-9-11-death-threats-57169352)\]

Her outspoken politics even contributed to her famous falling out with her conservative father, actor Jon Voight, in early 2002:

>""My father tried to cancel my first trip \[to a refugee camp\]. I was furious with him. Maybe he thought he was protecting my physical safety. But what I needed was my soul.  
>  
>All I can say is that the final letter I got, that was the final break. He handed it to me when I was on the way to Cambodia with the UN to go into a minefield for the first time. That's the day he handed me this letter to tell me that I was a bad person."" \[Rolling Stone magazine, July 2003\]

Angelina Jolie has visited with Palestinian refugees in Jordan on multiple occasions; I leave you with this abbreviated excerpt from her [journal](https://www.unhcr.org/sites/default/files/legacy-pdf/4a07ee4a6.pdf) describing one such visit in 2003:

>The children perform a play about Jerusalem. It is about Arab children and how they live. They are holding hands around the smallest child. “Message to all the people of the world. Look at the Palestinian children. Look at us here.”  
>  
>“Help and pray to God to protect us.” They huddle in groups to show how they hide during the bombings. “No one hears us these days. The sword has cut through our leather.” (Smiles, fists in the air) “Palestine, your name is in our veins; as long as we’re living you are our hero, precious to us.”  
>  
>In the school the children are between the ages of 4 and 12 years old. Their dream is to see their homeland. To live as citizens of a country they belong to. Most want to be teachers and doctors. One says architect, one lawyer. I ask why? “To make justice for people, there needs to be more justice.”  
>  
>Thursday they study and do handcrafts. They also have competitions and plays. I ask. “What is the most difficult thing about living in a camp?” They all say, “The cold weather, the night and the sandstorms.” A little voice says, “The storms.”  
>  
>As I am leaving a little Palestinian girl pats my arm. She wants to whisper in my ear. ""Please help us."" As we leave the tent the children flash peace signs.

green,185diib,149,,r/Palestine,"I taught in Palestine for 7 months from 2020-2021 and it has happened many times that I’ve had to go to bat for Palestinian people but the blatant lies that we are being told about its people and its culture recently is insane to me. 

The idea that Palestinian people are terrorists, that women don’t have rights there, that they would murder you if you were gay. This propoganda by Israel that’s repeated by J*e Biden makes my blood boil. They are all LIES. 

Palestinian people are to this day, the friendliest people I’ve ever met. Living there made me take a long hard look at my life and it was a huge factor in my not wanting to return to Europe because people were just so mean and miserable. 

I was invited into peoples homes after exchanging a few words with them. My belongings and groceries were returned to me after being chased down for it. People always offered me rides when they saw me walking in the hot sun. Feasts were prepared upon arrival into entering people’s homes. A group of ladies invited my coworker and I into their hamam party where they were just dancing and singing in a circle. 

Even when the situation with Israel was spoken about, not one antisemitic word. My students didn’t say anything hateful, they always expressed, “the Israelis want to kills us.” 

Seeing people curate the narrative for a people who is constantly denied autonomy is just making my blood boil. The messed up thing is that it’s so difficult to go there. My visa had to be bribed as it is Israel who approved it, but it is very hard to go there legally. They make it almost impossible for a Palestinian to leave as well.

Hasan said the only disagreement he has is he doesn't believe saying ""free Palestine"" after the terrorist attacks means you're pro-Hamas. But also understands Ethan's feelings since he lived in Israel, has an Israeli wife and in-laws that live in Israel. 

He confirmed Leftovers is happening tomorrow and they will be discussing Israel/Palestine. He didn't say much else other than he finds it extremely callous of people to get excited about the situation as some sort of podcast juicy gossip when it is a terribly violent conflict causing the death of many civilians.

There’s a [Crash Course video on the history of the conflict](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wo2TLlMhiw). 

But on October 7th, there was a horrific terrorist attack in which the organization Hamas killed over a thousand Israeli civilians and kidnapped hundreds more. Hamas is a militant group that has frequently attacked Israel (and also killed many Palestinian civilians). Hamas has been the primary political leadership in the Gaza Strip since a [coup in 2007](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Gaza_(2007)).

This attack is especially horrifying because it represented the [greatest loss of civilian life](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/10/12/hamass-attack-was-the-bloodiest-in-israels-history) among Jewish people since the Holocaust, and I think it’s important to understand that many of us don’t know what it’s like to be less than one human lifetime removed from a systematic effort to end your people via the murder of over six million of them. Amid a huge surge of anti-Semitic actions globally, echoes of that tragedy, whether they come in the form of attacks on synagogues or lynch mobs in Dagestan, are especially terrifying because of the history involved.

One thing I think we find challenging as a species is to acknowledge the shared legitimacy of conflicting narratives. That is to say, there is legitimacy to the Israeli narrative that Jews need a secure homeland because historically when they haven’t had one, it has been catastrophic, and as we have seen again recently, anti-Semitism continues to be a terrifyingly powerful and profound force in the human story. There is also legitimacy to the Palestinian narrative that over the last seven decades, many Palestinians have been forced off their land and now live as stateless refugees in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, where their freedom of movement and assembly is highly restricted, and that the long history of violence in the region has disproportionately victimized Palestinians.

For civilians in Gaza, there is simply nowhere to go. They cannot go to Egypt, and they cannot go to Israel. And since Hamas’s terrorist attack, thousands of bombs have been dropped by the Israeli government onto areas of Gaza where civilians cannot help but be. The Israeli government argues the war is necessary to remove Hamas from power and cripple it as a military force. But the human cost of those bombings is utterly devastating, and I’m not convinced that civilian death on such a scale can ever be justified. Thousands of civilians have died in Gaza in the past three weeks, and many thousands more will die before Hamas is completely destroyed, which is the stated goal of the Israeli offensive. It’s heartbreaking. So many innocent people are being traumatized and killed–children and elderly people and disabled people who are unable to travel to the purportedly safer regions of Gaza. And I don’t think it’s “both sidesism” to say that civilian death from violence is, on any side, inherently horrific.

Save the Children, an organization we trust and have worked with for over a decade, recently said, “The number of children reported killed in just three weeks in Gaza is more than the number killed in armed conflict globally … for the last three years.” Doctors without Borders, another organization we’ve worked with closely, reports: “There is no safe space in Gaza. When fuel runs out, every person on a ventilator, premature baby in an incubator will die. We need an immediate ceasefire.” I am trying to listen to a variety of trusted voices, and this is what some of the voices I trust are telling me.

I don’t know what else to say except that I’m so scared and sad for all people who live in constant fear and under constant threat. I pray for peace, and an immediate end to the violence. But mostly, I am committed to listening. Even when it is hard to listen, even when I am listening to those I disagree with, I want to do so with real openness and in search of understanding. I will continue to try to listen a lot more than I speak–not just when it comes to this conflict, but with all issues where I have a lot to learn.

,17hkqzi,570,,r/relationship_advice,"Hi friends,

So, a little background to the title is a must...
My partner had her birthday the other day. I baked her a cake, we had a romantic evening with wine and cheese, and her friends came over and surprised her.

All in all, she was happy and just kept telling me what a fun day she had.

When we went to bed, trouble came...

She asked me for some ""tinglies"". Basically she likes it when I run my fingers through her hair, or whisper in her ear or just draw on her back. 
I told her I was too tired, as we stayed up later than usual with her friends and I was not up for it.

This turned into a small argument where she said that it's the only thing she wanted. And that I haven't been doing it for her lately, and that ahe thought that at least on her birthday I could do it for her etc etc...

Then, it turned to tears.
Please note that after offering to do it for her anyways she said no because she was too upset.

Now, she has barely spoken to me the last few days. She said she feels like I need to make it up to her somehow and the fact that I haven't done so yet and just said I was sorry wasn't good enough.

Here's where tou guys/gals can help...

Is there anything that I can do to remedy this? We have been together for 5 years and this is tge first time I'm feeling lost as to how I can make up to her.

Sidenote, we live in Israel, where there's currently a war going on so going out to eat is out of the question.

Please help?
Thank, friends.

EDIT: Guys, I know it's difficult to keep your opinions to yourselves, but I really don't think this post is the place to begin the whole ""Israel is wrong"" or ""Jews deserve to die"" or even ""Destroy Palestine"". Not the place.
If you feel strongly about it, I am happy to discuss anything in private.

This place should be supportive and wholesome regardless of my place of birth/residence. Otherwise it seems a little antisemitic.

The American Postal Workers Union is shocked and saddened by the tragic and ongoing violence in Israel and Palestine. As working people, we stand with the oppressed and the innocent, thousands of whom have lost their lives in the last month.

As a union that stands for equality, social justice, human and labor rights, and international solidarity, we unite with unions and people of goodwill around the world in calls for justice and peace.

We unreservedly condemn the Hamas violence of October 7, which killed over 1,000 Israeli civilians and saw the kidnapping of more than 200 people.

However, Israel’s response has made the prospects for peace more remote. Over 10,000 innocent civilians, including 4000 children, have been killed by the relentless and indiscriminate bombing campaign on Gaza. Israel has shut off the flow of food, water, fuel and medical supplies to the Gaza Strip, a war crime. A humanitarian catastrophe is unfolding every day in Gaza. Thousands more innocent civilians stand to die wholly preventable deaths.

We call on our government, which is the primary foreign benefactor of the Israeli government, to use all its power to protect innocent lives and to help bring about peace in the region, and not use our tax dollars for more war.

We join the calls for an immediate ceasefire, the release of hostages, and urgently needed massive humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza. The cries of humanity demand nothing less.
